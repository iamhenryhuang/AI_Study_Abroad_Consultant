  "https://cse.mit.edu/programs-admissions/cse-phd-program": "CSE PhD Program Overview\nStudents in the standalone CSE PhD program create an individualized program of study in consultation with their advisors and program leadership which consists of nine graduate subjects and a graduate seminar. Core and concentration subjects cover six “ways of thinking” fundamental to CSE:\ndiscretization and numerical methods for partial differential equations;\noptimization methods;\nstatistics and data-driven modeling;\nhigh-performance computing and/or algorithms;\nmathematical foundations (e.g., functional analysis, probability);\nmodeling (i.e., a subject that treats mathematical modeling in any science or engineering discipline).\nResearch is an integral aspect of the program; students begin their thesis research upon matriculation. The emphasis of thesis research activities is the development and analysis of broadly applicable computational approaches that advance the state of the art. Students are awarded the Doctor of Philosophy in Computational Science and Engineering upon successful completion of the program requirements and defense of a thesis describing significant contributions to the CSE field.\n“This program recognizes the existence of computational science and engineering as a discipline in and of itself, so you don’t have to be doing this work through the lens of mechanical or chemical engineering, but instead in its own right.”\nNicolas Hadjiconstantinou\nCCSE Co-Director & Quentin Berg Professor of Mechanical Engineering\nCSE PhD Program Requirements\nComputational Science and Engineering Doctoral Program Guide\nProgram of Study\n111 graduate credit units, consisting of the following:\nCore (60 units)\nNumerical linear algebra (18.335)\n4 subjects, covering 4 of 6 core areas (“ways of thinking” foundational to CSE)\nDiscretization and numerical methods for PDE\nOptimization methods\nInference, statistical computing, and data-driven modeling\nHigh performance computing, software engineering, and algorithms\nMathematical foundations (e.g., functional analysis, probability)\nComputational modeling (i.e., a subject that treats the application of computational methods to modeling in any science or engineering discipline)\nConcentration (24 units)\nUnrestricted electives (24 units)\nDoctoral seminar in CSE (CSE.900, 3 units)\nQualifying Evaluation\nThe purpose of the CSE PhD qualifying evaluation is to assess whether students are successfully developing the necessary knowledge and attributes of CSE doctoral candidates at MIT. CSE PhD’s qualifying evaluation is course-based. Specifically:\nStudents must designate which three of their five core subjects will be used as their qualifying subjects no later than at the start of their third regular semester.\nA core subject associated with the student’s computational concentration must be one of these three qualifying subjects.\nSubjects taken before a student declares and receives program approval for their individual list of qualifying subjects may be used at the discretion of program leadership.\nAny transfer credit(s) received may not be used towards the qualifying evaluation.\nStudents are required to obtain an A grade (with any modifier) in all three qualifying subjects and also have a minimum cumulative GPA of 4.5 out of 5.0 at the time of qualification to be deemed successful.\nIf a student receives a grade less than an A- in a designated subject, the student must discuss an alternative with the assistant director and/or co-directors.\nAll qualifying subjects must be successfully completed no later than the fourth regular semester.\nDoctoral Thesis Committee\nAfter successful completion of the qualifying evaluation and no later than the end of the fifth regular semester, CSE PhD candidates must form their Doctoral Thesis Committees and hold an initial meeting. The thesis committee consists of a minimum of three members, at least two of whom must be MIT faculty members:\nThesis advisor: must be an MIT faculty member or principal/senior research scientist.\nCommittee chair: must be a CCSE faculty member or principal/senior research scientist.\nNote: if the advisor is CCSE-affiliated, then the advisor may fulfill both the role of the advisor and chair.\nIn addition to the committee chair, one other committee member must be CCSE-affiliated faculty or principal/senior research scientist.\nAny committee member external to MIT must hold a doctoral degree.\nCandidates should form their committees after consultation with their advisors and, if needed, the Co-Directors by contacting qualified individuals (as described above), discussing research plans and objectives, and verifying their willingness to serve on the committee. Once a candidate has finalized their committee members, this information must be reported to CCSE via the Thesis Committee Membership form.\nThe thesis committee is responsible for monitoring and providing advice on the doctoral candidate’s academic and research progress. The committee does not assume responsibility for the quality of the research performed; rather, its role is to critically evaluate the progress reported and offer suggestions and advice which may help the candidate in pursuit of their research goals. The quality of the research is the sole responsibility of the candidate and is the essential measure by which the faculty judge performance in the doctoral program.\nThesis Proposal  & Thesis Proposal Defense\nAfter the initial thesis committee meeting, CSE PhD candidates are required to submit a written thesis proposal and participate in an oral thesis proposal defense. The objectives of the thesis proposal and proposal defense are to ensure that the student has:\ndeveloped a deep understanding of their research field, including a comprehensive and critical review of the relevant literature,\nidentified a problem that could produce a doctoral-quality contribution, and\ndevised a reasonable plan for how to proceed.\nThe thesis proposal must be successfully defended by the end of the student’s sixth regular semester in the program.\nThesis & Thesis Defense\nThe doctoral thesis document is a major, original work that makes a significant contribution in its field. It is the principal component of the doctoral program, and the part that serves as the major indicator of the candidate’s abilities. Work already completed elsewhere, not under the supervision of a member of the MIT faculty, cannot be accepted in full or partial fulfillment of the thesis requirement.\nPlease see the Computational Science and Engineering Doctoral Program Guide section 3.8. Thesis and Thesis Defense for more detailed information.\nAcademic Performance & Progress\nCSE students are expected to maintain a grade point average (GPA) of at least 4.5 (out of 5) during the course of their studies to be considered in good academic standing.\nIf a student’s term GPA is at or below 4.0 for two sequential terms, if a student receives an Unsatisfactory (“U”) grade in CSE.THG, or if a grade of C or lower is given in any subject, the student is failing to meet minimum program requirements; a program warning letter will be issued and the MIT Graduate Academic Performance Group (GAPG) may be alerted.\nIf a student receives a grade of D in any subject, that subject may not be used to satisfy CSE PhD curricular requirements. Additionally, subjects taken with the graduate P/D/F grading option cannot be used to satisfy the CSE PhD Program of Study.\nStudents who fail to meet the academic performance requirements are expected to make substantial improvement by the end of the following term to return to good academic standing. Failure to meet this expectation may lead to additional actions taken, up to and including a warning from the Vice Chancellor, being allowed to register only for a less advanced degree, and/or denial of further registration.\nStudents who feel that their performance may not be meeting the CSE PhD academic performance requirements or have extenuating circumstances that need attention should contact the CCSE assistant director as soon as possible to discuss their individual situation and ways the program and Institute can better support them.\nForms for Current Students\nConsidering Applying?\nApplicants to the CSE PhD program are expected to have an undergraduate degree in CSE, applied mathematics, or another field that prepares them for an advanced degree in CSE, as well as relevant research experience.\nLearn More & Apply",

Students in their final year of undergraduate study may be admitted on the condition that their bachelor’s degree is awarded before they enroll at MIT.\nApplicants without an SM degree may apply to the doctoral programs, however, the Departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Mechanical Engineering nominally require the completion of an SM degree before a student is considered a doctoral candidate. As a result, applicants to those departments holding only a bachelor’s degree are asked in the application to indicate whether they prefer to complete the CSE SM program or an SM through the home department.\nCCSE’s graduate offerings require some background in computational science and engineering (CSE) and lead to degrees in CSE. They are not programs in computer science (CS). In particular, they have a different research and education focus from MIT’s computer science programs. Prospective students who are instead interested in a graduate degree in computer science should explore MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).",

Please visit the MIT Registrar’s Tuition and fees page for details.\nDoes CCSE offer conditional admission?\nNo. Only applicants who have met all the necessary requirements may be offered admission. However, all offers of admissions do come with certain conditions, such as immigration requirements, satisfactory undergraduate degree completion, or the provision of official documents, such as transcripts, for verification.\nWhat’s the average GPA for students admitted to the programs?\nWe receive applications from people attending institutions of higher education all over the world, which means a wide range of different GPA scales, and sometimes no GPA scale at all. Therefore we do not track or provide the average GPA of admitted students, however MIT graduate coursework is quite rigorous so competitive applicants are expected to have a demonstrated record of academic excellence.\nCan I visit CCSE? Do you offer tours or arrange meetings for prospective students?\nNo, CCSE does not offer tours or facilitate meetings between prospective students and CCSE-affiliated students, faculty or staff.\nIf you are interested in visiting MIT, the Institute Events office has created useful information to help you plan your visit. The MIT Welcome Center also offers campus tours, which you may sign up for online.\nAre CCSE’s PhD programs available as part-time or hybrid/remote learning opportunities?\nNo, students must enroll full time and be present at MIT’s Cambridge, MA campus to complete CSE PhD / Dept-CSE PhD degree requirements.\nCan I apply to both the CSE PhD and Dept-CSE PhD in the same admission cycle?\nNo, applicants must select one program per application cycle. While both programs enable students to specialize at the doctoral level in a computation-related field via focused coursework and a thesis, they differ in essential ways, and therefore are not intended to be interchangeable.\nThe standalone CSE PhD program is intended for students who plan to pursue research in cross-cutting methodological aspects of computational science. The resulting doctoral degree in Computational Science and Engineering is awarded by CCSE via the the Schwarzman College of Computing.\nIn contrast, the interdisciplinary Dept-CSE PhD program is intended for students who are interested in computation in the context of a specific engineering or science discipline. For this reason, this degree is offered jointly with participating departments across the Institute; the interdisciplinary degree is awarded in a specially crafted thesis field that recognizes the student’s specialization in computation within the chosen engineering or science discipline.\nOccasionally the admission committee may determine an applicant might be better suited to the program they did not indicate and consider the applicant for the other program. Likewise, occasionally the admission committee may determine a Dept-CSE applicant might be better suited for a department they did not indicate and consider the applicant for a different home department.\nCan I apply to both the Dept-CSE PhD and the department program directly in the same admission cycle?\nWhile this is not necessary or encouraged, applicants may opt to apply to as many MIT programs as they chose. However, a complete application, including all supporting materials and application fee, is required for each department/program.\nCan I transfer between programs if admitted?Can I transfer into either program if I’m a doctoral candidate at another institution?\nNo, transfers between programs are not permitted, nor can doctoral students at other institutions transfer into either of CCSE’s programs without applying.\nProspective students interested in attending CCSE’s programs must apply through the regular application process. If admitted, they would start in the program as a first year and would need to complete all program requirements.\nI’m a current MIT graduate student. Can I transfer into the CSE PhD or Dept-CSE PhD program?\nThe CSE PhD program does not accept transfers from other MIT programs. Anyone who wishes to be considered for admission to the CSE PhD must follow the regular application process. There are no ‘off-cycle’ applications accepted for the CSE PhD program.\nCurrent MIT graduate students enrolled in a participating home department’s doctoral program may be eligible to add the CSE specialization. Please see the PhD Admission for Current MIT Grad Students page for more information (Kerberos log in required).\nI already hold a PhD in a different field. Can I apply to the CSE PhD or Dept-CSE PhD program?\nNo, individuals who already have a doctoral degree are encouraged to seek postdoctoral opportunities.\nApplication Questions\nWhat is the deadline to apply? Can I apply late? Can I submit materials after the deadline?\nThe application deadline is December 1st. Applications will not be accepted after this date.\nAll supplemental materials (e.g., transcripts, test scores, letters of recommendation) must also be received by December 1. Application review begins immediate after the deadline passes, and incomplete applications may not be reviewed. Please be sure that your recommenders are aware of this hard deadline, as we do not make exceptions. Applicants may upload an updated transcript with fall grades recorded, if they opt to, but beyond that not additional changes to the application are allowed after the Dec 1 deadline.\nWhat time does the application close on deadline day?\nCCSE’s programs in the Eastern U.S. time zone. Applications close at 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the application deadline.\nWill submitting my application early make a difference in when I receive a decision?\nNo, all applications are reviewed after the deadline and decisions are released mid-February through early-March. Submitting an application prior to the deadline date will not expedite an admission decision.\nHow do I check the status of my application?\nApplicants should log into their online application via apply.mit.edu/apply/ to view the most up to date information available. Applicants are asked not to email requesting an application status update.\nCan I submit additional material in support of my application?\nNo, we do not allow students to upload/submit additional materials (e.g. degree certificates, extra recommendations, publications, etc.) beyond what is specifically requested in the application.\nCan I submit letters of recommendation via Interfolio?\nNo, the online application system does not support direct integration with Interfolio; please follow the instructions provided within the application to request letters of recommendation.\nHow long should my statement of objectives be? What should I include in my statement?\nCSE PhD and Dept-CSE PhD statements should be limited to approximately one page; not to exceed two pages. While there is not a set character/word count please be considerate of the reviewers who are reading numerous applications at a time; be less concerned with page length/word count and more concerned with presenting key points in a concise, clear manner.\nJoint program applicants will also be prompted to respond to departmental questions based on departments of interest; these may include specific word counts so please follow directions provided within the application.\nI applied previously, can I / how do I reapply?\nWe do not retain application materials for individuals who were not admitted and generally we do not encourage applicants to apply multiple times.\nHowever, if an individual decides to apply again they may but will need to submit a complete application, including application fee, and letters of recommendation. In the case of a reapplication, an individual should highlight what has changed that makes them a strong candidate since they last applied.\nCan I use the same login that I used in a previous application cycle?\nYes, applicants can reuse their login information from one year to the next.\nWhen will I receive my admission decision?\nAlthough we do everything we can to streamline the process, graduate admissions decisions are labor intensive and take time to determine. Generally decisions may be released on rolling basis starting in approximately January and continuing through February and March.\nWhat should I do if I experience a technical issue with the application?\nPlease email gradadmissions@mit.edu with a description of the issue, including relevant screen shots.\nGRE and English Language Proficiency Questions\nIs the GRE required?\nYes, all applicants are required to provide valid Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Aptitude Test scores sent to MIT by ETS.\nThe MIT code for submitting GRE score reports is 3514 (you do not need to list a department code). GRE scores must current; ETS considers scores valid for five years after the testing year in which you tested.\nCan I get a waiver of the GRE requirement?\nNo, all applicants are required to provide valid GRE general scores. This cannot be waived for the 2026 application cycle.\nShould I send GRE subject test scores?\nApplicants are not required to send any GRE subject test scores.\nWhat’s the English Language Proficiency requirement?What tests of English language proficiency are accepted and what are the minimum scores required?\nThe CSE PhD & Dept-CSE PhD programs require international applicants from non-English speaking countries to provide official score reports from one of the following tests of English language proficiency:\nthe academic version of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS; preferred)\nThe minimum IELTS academic score required for admission is 7\nthe Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) iBT\nThe minimum TOEFL iBT score required for admission is 100\nthe Duolingo English Test (DET; new trial option for Sept 2026 application cycle)\nThe minimum DET score required for admission is 135\nCan the English Language Proficiency requirement be waived?\nThe English Language Proficiency requirement is waived for international applicants for which one or more of the following are true:\nEnglish is/was the language of instruction in your four-year undergraduate program,\nEnglish is the language of your employer/workplace for at least the last four years,\nEnglish was your language of instruction in both primary and secondary schools.\nApplications from individuals who do not either meet the stated minimum scores or qualify for a waiver of the English language proficiency requirement will not be considered.",

Additional information, including any future plans to restart external admissions, will be posted here if/when they become available.\nAre You a Current MIT Grad Student Interested in CSE?\nCurrent MIT graduate students enrolled in a research-based master’s and/or doctoral degree program may be eligible to apply for the CSE SM as a secondary degree.\nMore Info for Current MIT Grad Students\nProgram Overview\nThe master’s degree in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), previously the Computation for Design and Optimization (CDO) SM program, is an interdisciplinary program designed to prepare tomorrow’s engineers and scientists in advanced computational methods and applications. The program provides a strong foundation in computational approaches to the design and operation of complex engineered and scientific systems.\nAs an interdisciplinary academic program, the CSE SM is housed in the Center for Computational Science & Engineering but students have the opportunity to work with faculty from across the Institute.  Through hands-on projects and a master’s thesis, students develop and apply advanced computational methods to a diverse range of applications, from aerospace to nanotechnology, from Internet protocols to telecommunications system design. Career opportunities for CSE SM graduates include companies and research centers where systems modeling, numerical simulation, design and optimization play a critical role.\nProgram Curriculum1\nCSE SM Catalog Listing\nThe CSE SM program is designed with a common core that serves all engineering disciplines, and an elective component that focuses on particular applications. Students must complete coursework distributed as described below (F = course offered in Fall semester; S = course offered in Spring semester).\nCore Subjects (3 course / 36 units)\nStudents are required to take three of four core subjects designed to provide foundation materials needed for the study of more advanced elective topics. The core subjects are chosen from the following:\n6.7310[J] / 18.335[J] Introduction to Numerical Methods (S)\n2.096[J] / 6.7300[J] / 16.910[J] Introduction to Numerical Simulation (F)\n2.097[J] / 6.7330[J] / 16.920[J] Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations (F)\n6.C57[J] / 15.C57[J] / IDS.C57 [J] (formerly 6.7200[J] / 15.093[J]) Optimization Methods (F)\nRestricted Electives(2 courses / 24 units)\nStudents choose two graduate-level electives from a list of over 50 specialized subjects that have computational themes and related components, and that are aligned with the program’s educational mission. The current list of approved restricted elective (RE) subjects can be found in the CSE SM Catalog Listing.\nUnrestricted Elective(1 course / 12 units)\nStudents may choose any graduate-level 12-unit subject from the MIT Subject Listing and Schedule.\nThesis(36 units)\nStudents write a master’s thesis under the supervision of a faculty advisor.\n*Courses that can be repeated for credit cannot be used to satisfy multiple CSE SM requirements.Subjects taken with the graduate P/D/F grading option cannot be used to satisfy CSE SM curricular requirements. ↩︎\nOther Program Details\nAcademic Performance Policy\nCSE SM students are expected to maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 4.5 (out of 5) during the course of their studies. If a student’s term GPA is at or below 4.0 for two sequential terms, if a student receives an Unsatisfactory (“U”) grade in CSE.THG, or if a grade of C or lower is given in any subject, a warning from the CCSE co-directors will be issued to the student, and the MIT Graduate Academic Performance Group will be alerted.\nPlease see the Office of the Dean for Graduate Education’s Academic Performance page for more information.\nEnglish Language Proficiency\nAll CSE SM students are required to take the Graduate Writing Exam run by the MIT Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies.  Students who do not receive a passing score are required to take 21W.794 Graduate Technical Writing Workshop.  Students may choose to take the workshop with P/D/F grading (rather than an A – F letter grade), however they must receive a P grade.\nProgram Timing\nThe CSE SM program is designed so that students who are either self-supported or on fellowship can complete the program in 12-18 months. Students supported by research assistant or teaching assistant funds should allow two years to complete the program.\nFunding\nThe CSE SM program cannot guarantee financial support for each admitted student, however we make every effort to match admitted students with affiliated faculty who can offer financial support through a sponsored research project.\nThe CSE SM program does not providing funding to students who pursue it as a secondary degree concurrent with a MIT SM or PhD program.",
