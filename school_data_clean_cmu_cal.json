With an interest in problem solving and a passion for helping people, Maegan attended Georgia Tech where her research into above-the-knee prosthetics led her to pursue a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Caltech. Maegan was drawn to Caltech's small size and collaboration-focused community. In the spirit of collaboration, Maegan recently co-wrote a paper with fellow classmate, Ellen Novoseller, that won best conference paper at the International Conference of Robotics and Automation. Her co-author added an important machine learning component to her studies, illustrating the power of cross-disciplinary collaboration that is facilitated by the intimate size of Caltech. Maegan's passion for mechanical engineering is evident even when she is not in the lab. She spends her free time designing and building mechanical keyboards from scratch. She prefers the feel of mechanical keyboards over mass-produced ones and enjoys how customizable they can be. She says \"Everyone should give them a try!\"Maegan's research focuses on developing exoskeleton technology. Specifically, Maegan's interest is in the \"science of walking.\" Focusing on theory, Maegan studies how humans walk and how robots can replicate this activity. Using mathematics, she characterizes the stability and robustness of walking robots, and hopes to develop robots with a natural and comfortable walking pattern that can assist people. The exoskeletons Maegan works with are not only programmed to physically aid their wearers, but also to learn from their muscle movements! Post-Caltech, Maegan will pursue further studies as a postdoctoral fellow and hopes to ultimately run her own lab.

Charles is impressed with Caltech's tight-knit community of diverse and passionate students and has especially enjoyed working with the brilliant undergraduates here.In Kaihang Wang's laboratory in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, Charles has devoted himself to developing powerful new tools to address questions in synthetic biology. Using bacteria as a model system, he is using bacterial conjugation to transfer large portions of the genome between different species of bacteria. Ultimately, this approach will allow him to explore how the genome determines the boundaries between distinct species of bacteria. He is also working to extend this technology into mammalian cells. Charles appreciates the lab's exploratory nature, which gives him the freedom to pursue innovative projects.\nZoom In to Image\nCharles standing next to an Echo Revolve, a revolving fluorescent microscope.\nImage Lightbox\nCharles standing next to an Echo Revolve, a revolving fluorescent microscope.\nDownload Full Image\nZhuoran QiaoAdvisor: Thomas Miller // Chemistry // G2Proud to call himself the first scientist in his family, Zhuoran Qiao has always been motivated by a desire to understand how the world works through science. After undergraduate study at Peking University and an internship at Harvard University, Zhuoran came to Caltech from China to pursue a PhD in Chemistry. Zhuoran feels that one of Caltech's greatest strengths is the passion of its students and faculty to achieve great discoveries that impact society as a whole.Zhuoran arrived at Caltech with a passion for using artificial intelligence to explore the behavior of quantum mechanical systems, which is previously only accessible by solving the wave function from the Schrödinger equation. He has gone on to develop a novel strategy called \"OrbNet\" that uses machine learning to efficiently predict solutions to Schrödinger's equation, including its application to larger molecules like proteins. OrbNet is able to achieve accurate solutions with far cheaper computational cost compared to previous methods. Zhuoran's breakthrough has already made waves, being chosen as an Editor's Pick in the Journal of Chemical Physics. His method has many practical applications. For example, it can be used to predict binding affinities between a ligand and various drugs, and has been used by pharmaceutical companies like Amgen.\nZoom In to Image\nAs a theorist, Zhuoran does not work in a lab.\nImage Lightbox\nAs a theorist, Zhuoran does not work in a lab.\nDownload Full Image\nAnastasia BuyalskayaAdvisor: Colin Camerer // Social and Decision Neuroscience // G4As an undergraduate, Anastasia majored in economics and worked in finance, drawn to markets which were presumed to be efficient and governed by rational individuals. But it became increasingly clear that there was a disconnect between what she was studying and seeing in the real world. \"Investment experts were making decisions that were systematically influenced by their emotions, their cognitive biases, and their ego.\" At BlackRock, where she worked for five years before coming to Caltech, she worked with investment teams to understand and mitigate behaviors that were leading to suboptimal decision making, eventually launching a behavioral finance initiative and constructing a Behavioral Finance course for thousands of investors. \"My work at BlackRock involved applying other people's research and I got the itch to do my own. I wanted to learn how to test theory, run experiments, and to answer questions about human behavior which hadn't been answered yet.\" Having seen how disciplines outside economics can shed light on economic models, Anastasia sought out a graduate school program that would be interdisciplinary (her field – behavioral science – is relatively new and came out of interdisciplinary collaborations), which led her to Caltech.Anastasia's research focus has been understanding habit formation. \"So much of our behavior is not a utility maximization problem. Think of brushing your teeth – most of us execute this behavior multiple times a day but give it very little cognitive attention. It is something we do automatically when we are cued by context.\" Anastasia explains that policies which aim to change behavior do not always work partly because those interventions appeal to the reflective, thinking mind rather than the automatic, habitual mind. She hopes her research – in partnership with her advisor Colin Camerer, and collaborators at the University of Pennsylvania – can shed light on how we might be able to better understand habitual behavior at the individual level and construct more targeted behavioral interventions. In addition to empirical work, Anastasia is interested in running experiments to study what leads habits to form. \"It's very difficult to study habit inside the lab because by definition subjects are in a new setting and less likely to act automatically,\" she explains. So Anastasia set up a field experiment in which she would have the control of a lab but the context of the field: installing a customizable vending machine that would allow her to study natural choices on Caltech's campus – collecting data around the clock, when people desired one of the options available. While the COVID-19 pandemic put a halt on her experiments in the short-term, she's looking forward to the day she can resume studying human habits \"in the wild.\"\nZoom In to Image\nAnastasia with the customizable vending machine she installed on Caltech's campus.\nImage Lightbox\nAnastasia with the customizable vending machine she installed on Caltech's campus.\nDownload Full Image",
  "https://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/admissions/frequently-asked-questions-for-admitted-students": "Frequently Asked Questions for Admitted Students\nRelated Pages\nFrequently Asked Questions for Admitted Students\nAcceptance and Registration\nWhat is the deadline to accept my offer of admission?\nCaltech is a signatory of the Council of Graduate Schools, which sets a deadline of April 15 to accept or decline offers of admission and financial support. If you have already accepted another offer, you are asked to withdraw that acceptance before accepting Caltech's offer. Extensions to the deadline may be granted in limited situations, and you should contact the admitting option to make the request.\nWhen does the Fall term begin?\nThe first day of classes for the Fall term 2026 begins on September 28, 2026. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for all of the important dates for the year.\nCan I start my PhD program in the summer?\nMost PhD students arrive at the start of the Fall term. However, students may request to begin research as early as the first day of the summer term. Early arrivals will be appointed as non-degree special students for the summer term and will enroll in 36 units of research. Non-degree special students are eligible for housing, a stipend, and will be billed for health insurance for the entire summer term unless otherwise approved for a waiver (see below for waiver information). Please note that as a non-degree student the units will not count towards the PhD degree requirements. Students participating in the Biology and Biological Engineering (BBE) Bootcamp in early fall will be appointed as a non-degree special student for the duration of the course.To request an early arrival, students must have a faculty sponsor who will be responsible for paying a stipend and assigning a research grade. Please contact the Option Representative of the admitting option directly to determine if an early arrival is possible.\nCan I defer my offer of admission?\nDeferrals are decided by the admitting option and if granted, are typically for one year. Deferrals of less than one year will depend upon the academic program; in some graduate options, first-year courses are sequential and it is not possible to matriculate mid-year. In rare cases, a deferral of two years is possible, and requests should be made directly to the admitting option. Deferred students will receive a revised admission letter and are asked to submit transcripts for any academic work undertaken during the deferral period. Typical reasons for deferral include attending a study abroad program, performing required military service, gaining work experience in your field that will benefit your PhD studies, visa delays, and personal/family obligations.\nWill I be able to visit campus?\nMany academic programs will have visiting days or an open house for admitted students where you can explore the campus, learn about the resources available, and meet with faculty, current graduate students, and fellow admits. Please contact your admitting option to find out if an in-person visit is planned. Some academic programs will also host virtual visits and you can contact your academic program for details.\nHow can I learn more about Caltech's resources?\nCaltech Shines is a series of virtual programs designed to introduce recently admitted graduate students to the larger Caltech community. These tailored programs feature presentations and Q&A sessions with representatives from an array of campus resources. Registration information will be sent to all newly admitted graduate students.\nWhen is Caltech's Graduate Student Orientation?\nThe main orientation, which is required for all graduate students, will take place from September 21 - 25, 2026. International students will participate in an additional orientation organized by International Student Programs (ISP) the week prior.\nHow long do the MS and PhD degrees typically take to complete?\nInstitute policy for the PhD program requires a minimum of three years (12 terms) of full-time enrollment; the average time-to-degree for PhD students is just under 6 years. For those academic programs that offer a terminal MS degree (Aeronautics, Electrical Engineering, and Space Engineering), the MS requirements can be completed in one academic year (9 months), but in some cases may be extended.\nCan an offer of admission to a graduate option be rescinded?\nIt is rare for an offer of admission to be rescinded. However, Caltech reserves the right to rescind an offer of admission. Reasons for such an action include, but are not limited to, the following:The application is found to contain misrepresentations (including inappropriate use of AI in personal essays), or there is concern about academic integrity.The applicant fails to obtain a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) or shows a significant drop in academic performance.The applicant engages in conduct that raises substantial doubt about the applicant's suitability for graduate studies within the admitting option.The applicant fails to obtain work authorization (more details below).If the admitting option decides to rescind the admission offer, that decision will be forwarded to the Dean of Graduate Studies. The Dean will consult with the graduate option to make a final decision and communicate that decision to the applicant.\nFaculty and Advising\nDoes Caltech offer laboratory rotations?\nIn some graduate options, rotations are designed to introduce students to faculty research groups that match their scientific interests. Some options expect a student to rotate with up to three groups during the first year. To find out whether your graduate option utilizes rotations, we suggest you contact your option representative or review the relevant websites for the particular options/divisions.\nWhat is the Caltech student-to-faculty ratio?\nCaltech has one of the nation's lowest student-to-faculty ratios, with 300 professorial faculty members offering a rigorous curriculum and access to varied learning opportunities and hands-on research to approximately 1,000 undergraduates and 1,400 graduate students.\nStipend Support, Financial Resources, Costs, and Tuition and Fees\nI was offered a stipend and tuition and mandatory fees in my first year.  What can I expect in future years?\nStudents are expected to make satisfactory progress towards their degree, including securing a research advisor and satisfying program requirements, in order to receive Institute funding. Once a student joins a research group, the advisor will often provide the primary funding, unless the student has an external award (i.e., NSF).Tuition and mandatory fees are also covered for all PhD students as a benefit of their funding package each year. The tuition and fees rate for academic year 2025-26 is $68,001. Additional fees for the remaining unsubsidized portion of the health, dental and vision insurance, parking permits, etc. are not covered by the mandatory fee coverage. See the Estimated Budget for current costs.\nWhen do students get paid and is the stipend taxable?\nStudents are paid monthly on or around the 26th of each month, depending upon the pay period. If the 26th falls on a holiday or a Sunday, payment will be made earlier in the week. The first stipend payment for Fall term will be October 26, 2026.Stipends are considered taxable income, but under current IRS regulations, tuition is not taxable. Tax rates will vary depending upon a student's individual taxable income, available tax treaties for foreign nationals, and other qualifying exemptions.\nAre there any resources to help cover moving or living expenses between the beginning of the term and the first stipend installment?\nCaltech offers a 0% interest loan of $3,000 to incoming students. The funds will be disbursed through the Bursar's Office starting on September 21, 2026, and repayment begins in April 2027 over the course of 18 months. New students interested in applying for the loan should complete and submit the response form no later than July 17, 2026. Further instructions will then be sent regarding completing the loan documents and the disbursement of funds.A few options also provide a one-time relocation/moving allowance, and if so, the details will be provided in the official offer of admission.\nAm I required to show evidence of work authorization?\nIn most cases, yes. Caltech normally provides full financial support throughout the graduate program for PhD students, and most of the funding sources require work authorization. As a consequence, matriculation into the PhD program requires evidence of work authorization, unless the admitting option is able to arrange special compensation.All students are required by law to complete Form I-9 within three business days of the start of employment. Caltech collects information for Form I-9 electronically and instructions will be emailed in the summer. The documentation required for Section 2 must be reviewed for authenticity by Human Resources (or ISP in the case of international students). Examples of acceptable documents can be found on page 8 here.\nWill I be required to be a TA (teaching assistant)?\nMost graduate students are expected to TA at some point in their graduate program. Some options require teaching experience as part of the curriculum. All incoming students are required to attend the annual Teaching Conference as part of Orientation, so you will have access to resources and training.\nIs health, dental and vision insurance included in the fees?  What can I expect to pay?\nAll graduate students are enrolled in Caltech's health insurance plan by default and expected to pay the student contribution. The rates are heavily subsidized by the Institute and students are billed for a small portion of the overall cost. Students who wish to opt out must apply for a waiver and meet the waiver requirements. Approximately 80% of the costs for health insurance are paid by Caltech, and the remainder is billed to students three times each year (see below for current rates paid by students). Dental and vision insurance are optional.Terms of CoverageFall term = September 1 - December 31Winter term = January 1 - April 30Spring/Summer terms = May 1 - August 31Rates for 2024-25Health insurance (single student*) = $266/per term or $798 annuallyDental insurance (single student*) = $135 annuallyVision (student + dependents) = $31.80 annually*Coverage for dependents is available at additional cost.For more information on the health, dental and vision plans and costs, please refer to Student Benefits.\nI am a parent. Are there additional resources for graduate students with children?\nCaltech has several resources for graduate students with families, including paid pregnancy and bonding leave, a parent support program fund, dependent health care reimbursements, a childcare assistance program, and a tuition assistance program at the Children's Center. For more information on these and other resources, please visit Graduate Student Parents.\nI have received an external fellowship that will support all or part of my graduate studies.  Who should I contact and how will this change my original financial offer?\nStudents who receive an external fellowship should notify the Graduate Studies Office and include a copy of the award letter if available. The original offer of admission from Caltech will then be revised to incorporate this award and a commensurate offer will be sent. In some cases, students may be allowed to defer their awards and/or combine this with the original offer, but these decisions are dependent upon availability of funds and the terms of the award. Students receiving external fellowships should consult with their graduate option about the best course of action. Students will never receive a lesser overall financial package upon receiving an external fellowship.\nIs it expensive to live in Pasadena and will my stipend be enough?\nPasadena and Southern California in general are expensive areas in which to live. However, Caltech's stipend is intended to cover basic living expenses for the area, including housing, meals, utilities, transportation and personal expenses. Students who are able to live in on-campus housing, which is subsidized, will likely have money to save. Refer to the Estimated Budget for more information on expected expenses.\nHousing and Residential Experience\nIs campus housing available for first-year students?\nCaltech provides a variety of on-campus housing options available to incoming graduate students. All new graduate students are guaranteed housing in their first year and can choose a living experience that best fits their needs. Just under half of Caltech's total graduate student population lives in campus housing. The new student housing application period opens on April 15 and closes April 30.After the first year, students are asked to join a housing lottery and the results of the lottery will be announced two months before the contract end date, so that students who are not able to secure on-campus housing can find alternate living arrangements. For additional information on Caltech's housing options and the lottery process for returning students, please refer to the Graduate Housing website.\nCan I have a pet if I live in campus housing?\nPets are not allowed in campus housing. A pet is defined as any animal in your residential space that is not a registered Service Animal or Emotional Support Animal.The prohibition of pets does not include emotional support animals or service animals. These animals go through a different approval process. Students need to register through Caltech's Accessibility Services for Students (CASS) for special accommodations.\nHow can I learn more about Caltech's housing process?\nAll newly admitted students are invited to join one of the virtual Housing Information Sessions offered through Caltech Shines. You will learn about the types of housing we have available, the application process, roommate selections, and deadlines. To register for one of the sessions, please follow the link for Caltech Shines in an email that will be sent to all admitted students.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nI have a disability.  Is there someone I can work with to request accommodations?\nCaltech is committed to providing reasonable support to students with disabilities and medical conditions (including temporary conditions) by providing academic adjustments, auxiliary aids and services and other disability-related accommodations consistent with legal requirements. Caltech will engage in an interactive process with students requesting accommodations to determine whether the accommodations are reasonable. This process is administered by Caltech's Accessibility and Services for Students (CASS) staff and may include input from academic advisors, faculty members, Student Wellness Services and, if necessary, outside experts.Students who have questions about the process for requesting accommodations, including eligibility requirements, are encouraged to consult with CASS. When appropriate, CASS may provide referrals for additional testing and/or evaluations. Testing is not offered through campus resources.\nI am an international student.  What resources and support services are available to me?\nInternational Student Programs (ISP) is ready to assist international students after they have accepted the Institute's admission offer. As the definitive immigration resource for international students, ISP is responsible for advising students on all immigration-related matters, such as visa acquisition, employment authorization, extensions of stay, and more. In addition, ISP provides programs that assist international students in adjusting to life in the United States. ISP plans and promotes events that celebrate international education and cultures of the world, address cross-cultural adjustment, and provide opportunities for international students to establish a sense of community at Caltech.\nCampus and Student Life\nWhat athletic and recreational facilities are available?\nCaltech offers a balanced program of individual and group activities through a variety of intercollegiate, physical education, club, intramural, and informal recreation activities intended to meet the needs of all members of the community. Further, we strive to educate the entire Caltech community toward excellent personal health and a balanced life approach through diverse programming. Membership for students is covered by the mandatory student fees, and a spouse/partner and family members can join for a small annual fee. Please check Athletics for more information and current rates.\nDoes Caltech have a graduate student government?\nCaltech's student government for graduate students is known as the Graduate Student Council (GSC). All enrolled Caltech graduate students are part of the GSC and are welcome to attend any of the regular meetings. Though small, Caltech is a rich and vibrant community. Interesting things are going on all the time, and we encourage you to take advantage of all that is happening.If there is a program that you'd like to see, or other suggestions that you have, visit the GSC website.\nWhat should I know about Pasadena and the greater Los Angeles county?\nIn and around Pasadena, there's something for everyone. Pasadena is nestled in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains and day trips can include a visit to the mountains for casual and serious hiking, skiing in the winter months, beautiful beaches, and desert landscapes. For those who prefer city life, there's an abundance of restaurants, museums and cultural activities, sporting venues, and entertainment hotspots.\nIs Caltech's campus safe?\nIn general, yes, but like most campuses we experience the occasional minor security concerns like theft and scams. We have an onsite security presence 24/7. Pasadena, similar to other cities has its share of less desirable locations and it is always wise to be aware of your surroundings and use caution when walking alone. For more information, please see Caltech's Annual Security and Fire Safety report.",
