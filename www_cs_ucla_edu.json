  "https://www.cs.ucla.edu/history": "Skip to content\nThe History of Computer Engineering & Computer Science at UCLA\nAuthor: Gerald Estrin, late Professor Emeritus\nIn the late 1940s, UCLA began to make pioneering contributions to the information revolution. A creative environment nurtured research and education in computer egineering and computer science. Some highlights of the period up to formal establishment of the UCLA Computer Science Department in 1968 follow:\n1947\nThe Institute for Numerical Analysis was set up on the UCLA campus under sponsorship of the National Bureau of Standards and with funding from the Office of Naval Research. The primary function of INA was “to conduct research and training in the types of mathematics pertinent to the efficient exploitation and further development of high-speed automatic digital computing machinery.” INA attracted a stream of internationally recognized applied mathematicians. Harry Huskey completed the SWAC (Standards Western Automatic Computer) development project in 1950, and it became one of the very few places where modern numerical experiments could be conducted. The SWAC provided a testing ground for computer engineers, programmers and applied mathematicians. George Forsythe was a key member of INA who later joined the Stanford faculty and became a leader of the movement to establish computer science programs in the USA. C. B. Tompkins headed INA in the mid-1950s and organized support to serve the computational needs of the entire campus; SWAC was replaced by large IBM computer systems.\n1948\nDean L. M. K. Boelter came to UCLA from Berkeley to head the College of Engineering. Boelter had an educational mission which was to break down the conventional specialization categories of departments in engineering, and to design unified engineering curricula leading to BS, MS and PhD degrees in engineering. Due to the universality of simulation tools in engineering, Professor Thomas A. Rogers was able to obtain support for analog computation. Two large analog computers, a mechanical differential analyzer and a network analyzer were received from General Electric. One of the first electronic analog computers, EASE, was designed and built at UCLA. Professor Walter Karplus joined the UCLA faculty in 1955 and played a key role in developing the field of scientific computing and numerical methods for solution of differential equations in engineering. Tom Rogers led computer lab and course development and created an early numerically controlled machine tool laboratory.\n1950\nAt RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, a project to build a von Neumann type machine was closely tracking the ongoing development t the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton (von Neumann often came West to consult at RAND and, in fit, his plan to relocate to UCLA was aborted by his death in February 1957). Before the Princeton machine was finished, one of the original members of the IAS engineering team, Willis Ware, left to head the RAND computer project. With Montgomery Phister, Ware began to offer evening introductory courses in digital computer design at UCLA.\n1956\nDean Boelter of the College of Engineering and Prof. C. B. Tompkins, director of the Institute for Numerical Analysis, joined forces to recruit Gerald Estrin to the UCLA engineering faculty from the von Neumann Electronic Computer Project at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton.The goal was to build a computer engineering research program and to initiate a full-time academic program to spark a new computer initiative. In 1958, Estrin formed the Digital Research Laboratory, and obtained extramural support from the Office of Naval Research, energy research agencies (AEC, ERDA, and DOE), the National Science Foundation, and DARPA to build research activity probing innovative computer architectures, parallel processing, models of computation, computer instrumentation, and computer networks. As a result, by 1968 a substantial body of doctoral dissertations, master’s theses and contributions to technical literature in computer engineering already existed when the formal proposal to establish a computer science department was made. Some of the early faculty appointments, in addition to Karplus and Estrin were: A. Avizienis (1962), B. Bussell (1960), J. Carlyle (1963), L. Kleinrock (1963), M. Melkanoff (1962) and A. Svoboda (1968). Melkanoff had extensive experience with computational physics and computer programming methods and he became the sparkplug for development of a computer science curriculum and formal establishment of the Computer Science Department at UCLA. Algirdas Avizienis retained his association with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory while he advanced his seminal work on fault tolerance. Leonard Kleinrock had finished his work at MIT and intended to move into industrial research, but he was attracted to the UCLA engineering faculty in the Information Systems Division. Kleinrock’s contributions to computer communications, queuing analysis, development of the ARPANET and teaching excellence have set remarkable standards for his colleagues ever since.\n1968-1969\nThese dates encompass the formal establishment of the UCLA Computer Science Department. There was a campus-wide interest in supporting a computer science program. In addition to computer engineering, those interested included faculty and research staff in biomathematics, business administration, the campus computing network, other engineering specialties, library services, mathematics, physiology, psychology and public health. By 1968, there were eleven faculty members in the School of Engineering who were involved in teaching and research in computer science related areas. In addition to the faculty mentioned above, this group included D. F. Martin, L. P. McNamee, and J. Vidal. An Information Systems Division had been established in the School of Engineering, and 70 MS and 43 PhD students were pursuing studies in system design, numerical applications and computer languages. On May 24, 1968, “A Proposal For a Program of Graduate Studies In Computer Sciencs For the MS and PhD Degrees” was submitted to the Academic Senate Graduate Council. The proposal to establish the Computer Science Department in the School of Engineering and Applied Science was approved in the 1968-1969 academic year. For historical interest, selected excerpts of that program are presented below:\nGoals of the Proposed Program\nTo provide the necessary courses, faculty and administrative structure to allow graduate students to obtain M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science at UCLA.\nTo provide necessary training, service and advanced courses in computer science to the whole student body and the faculty.\nTo provide a focus for teaching, research and development in computer science to the campus, as a whole.\nDefinition of Computer Science\nThe role of computer science, its importance and its relationship to other fields may be described as follows:\nThe predictive power of the inductive sciences, such as physics and chemistry, is predicated upon the use of symbolic models, consisting of idealized objects, corresponding to real objects, whose interaction is described through a set of mathematical axioms. The application of mathematical theorems to these axioms yield theoretical prediction which may be compared with events in the real world, thus establishing the validity of the model within a certain domain. Other sciences have attempted to develop symbolic models with considerably less success, due to the complexity required for a realistic model. The advent of the digital computer has greatly facilitated the construction, utilization and verification of such models, thereby providing new predictive powers to many disciplines which hitherto were limited to qualitative modeling, leading to uncertain predictions. For this to be effective and meaningful, however, the issue of what constitutes “realizable” models must be delineated and explored. Thus, the primary aim of computer science is to enhance scholarly advance by increasing our understanding of what constitutes realizable models and to extend the scope of realizability.",

Applications are accepted for Fall admission only.\nDue to the high volume of email inquiries, applicants will not receive a personalized response. Over the last few years, we have found that for 99% of the responses to these inquiries can be found on our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page. Most questions can be answered by simply reviewing or searching a topic, such as GRE, TOEFL, official transcripts, personal statement, letters of recommendation and document status on the above webpages.\nIn the rare instance when a question is not answered on one of the above webpages or in the general response below, a personalized email response may be provided. As a courtesy, please do not send the same question to multiple staff/faculty throughout the CS Department. Please send your question that is not listed on the Grad FAQ webpage to the CS Grad Student Affairs Office only. As noted in the above webpage, applicants are asked not to make email or phone inquiries about the receipt of documents. Doing so will delay our efforts to process application material.\nWhy should you consider a CS PhD program vs MS program?\nApplicants may only apply to either the CS PhD or the CS MS program. Applicants may not apply for both programs. Admission to the PhD program is more selective than for the M.S. program. In general, the admissions committee does not consider PhD applicants for admission into the M.S. program and vice versa.\nWhile a PhD degree prepares students not only for careers in research and academia, those who apply for a PhD degree typically demonstrate significant achievement in and/or potential for advancing knowledge through independent research and teaching. With a PhD, you become an expert in a topic that you’re passionate about. PhD students create new knowledge and new engineering artifacts that improve the program. The MS program is best suited for students who plan to work in the industry\nApplicants who hold only a bachelor’s degree may apply to the Ph.D. program. In recent years, the majority of PhD admitted applicants have completed only a bachelor’s degree.\nWhy should you a consider a CS PhD at UCLA?\nUS News: UCLA is the #1 public university in the country\n2022 US News Best Computer Science Schools: UCLA CS is ranked #11\nCS rankings.org: #1 in Cryptography, #2 in Computational Biology & Bioinformatics, #3 in Artificial Intelligence, #6 in Design Automation, #7 in Machine Learning & Data Mining, # 6 in Programming Languages and Software Engineering\nUCLA CS is the birthplace of Internet with a history of computing pioneers\nUCLA has a strong and diverse campus across the board\nUCLA has a top medical school with collaboration opportunities in Health Sciences and computational medicine\nProximity to Silicon Valley and “Silicon Beach”\nUCLA CS PhD program has a strong faculty placement record:\nIn 2020-2022 hiring seasons, our PhDs and postdocs were hired as faculty at the following institutions:\nArizona State University\nCarnegie Mellon University\nCornell University\nChinese Academy of Sciences\nDuke University\nHarvey Mudd College\nInstitute of Computing Technology,\nNew York University\nNortheastern University\nUniversity of California, Riverside\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nUniversity of Hong Kong\nUniversity of Maryland\nUniversity of Michigan\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\nUniversity of Southern California\nUniversity of Toronto\nToyota Technological Institute at Chicago\nPenn State University\nPurdue University\nYale University\nFaculty Excellence\nIn the 2018-2022, there have been 75 Awards where half are major awards (e.g., ACM Fellow, National Academy of Engineering) involving at least 22 distinct faculty across all major fields, which is a testament to breadth of excellence in UCLA Computer Science.

As noted in the above webpages, applicants are asked not to make email or phone inquiries about the receipt of documents. Doing so will delay our efforts to process application material.\nApplication/Admission Requirements and Data\nHow do I apply?\nTo apply for the Computer Science PhD or MS program, submit the UCLA application for graduate admission and select “Computer Science MS” or “Computer Science PhD” as your intended program of study. Applications are due by December 15 at 23:59 pm (Pacific Time).\nDoes the department provide “pre-application” reviews?\nIt is the prospective applicant’s responsibility to do their research and review this page, frequently asked questions, to determine their admission competitiveness, and academic and research fit with the university/program they are applying to. Due to the volume of applications and in fairness to all our applicants, we do not provide application feedback or “pre-application” reviews.\nWhat are the application requirements?\nAn applicant for admission must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university, must have the necessary academic preparation to complete graduate level courses in computer science, and must be able to score competitively on the GRE test. The university requires at least a scholastic average of B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or its equivalent if the letter grade system is not used. We expect at least a 3.50 GPA (on a 4.00 scale) in the junior and senior years, and at least 3.50 in any graduate study.\nThe GRE will not be required for the 2025-2026 Admissions cycle. Previously there are no minimums required for GRE.\nInternational students must submit a TOEFL with a score of at least 87 (computer-based) or 560 (paper-based), or an IELTS with a score of at least 7.0.\nConditional admission is not offered. A transitional or pre-master’s program is not available.\nDo you accept applications for admission for study beginning winter or spring quarter?\nNo. The Computer Science Department accepts applications for Fall quarter only. Applications should be submitted only between mid-September and the deadline of December 15.\nHow many applications do you receive, and how many students were admitted?\nFollowing are data for applicants admitted for study beginning Fall 2022.\nM.S.\nPh.D.\nApplicants\n3,200\n906\nAdmittees\n140\n47\nAverage GPA of all applicants/admittees: 3.75 (A=4.0)\nMy academic background is not in Computer Science. Am I eligible to apply to your graduate program? What are the prerequisites?\nThe vast majority of applicants have a background in computer science. Other majors represented include electrical engineering, math, statistics, and physics. For undergraduate work, we recommend 2 years of calculus (through differential equations and introduction to discreet structures), 1 year of physics (mechanics; Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields); and a statistics course. Additional recommended coursework in Computer Science include: Operating Systems Principles, Computer Network Fundamentals, Computer Systems Architecture, Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Compiler Construction, Data Management Systems, Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, Intro to Computer Graphics, Intro to Algorithms and Complexity.\nMany CS graduate courses have prerequisites which consist of CS upper division undergrad classes (which are only offered at 4 year institutions and not at community colleges). Therefore we recommend students review the Computer Science course catalog, look at the CS grad classes offered and look at the prerequisites for those classes. If you have not taken the class then the instructor may not allow you to take that course. While you may take CS upper division undergrad classes, note it may delay/impact you being able to finish within the 2 years.\nAn applicant without a strong computer science background may be a very competitive applicant. Having professional experience as well as having taken courses that are equivalent to prerequisites for upper division undergraduate coursework, and the upper division courses themselves, would be most helpful. Applicants best illustrate their professional experience by succinctly describing their skills and projects in the statement of purpose, and submitting letters of recommendation that relate their achievements and skills to their potential for success in their degree and career objectives.\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to take CS courses at U.S. 4-year state universities due to the priority rules favoring admitted, full-time degree seeking students, community colleges typically offer only the prerequisites of the prerequisites, and extension programs offer mainly application courses and not courses equivalent to upper-division courses. However, every course taken and/or work skill achieved leads to a more competitive application. UCLA does not offer a transitional or pre-admission program, and  does not consider applications for a second bachelor’s degree. Courses offered by UCLA Extension that have the exact same course number as the courses offered in UCLA undergraduate and graduate degree programs provide good preparation.\nMSCS Program\nThe Computer Science Department has a regular Master of Science Program, which is designed to nurture the next generation of computing professionals with the required depth and breadth of computer science knowledge.

  "https://www.cs.ucla.edu/graduate-requirements": "Skip to content\nGraduate Application Requirements\nDue to the high volume of email inquiries, applicants will not receive a personalized response. Over the last few years, we have found that for 99% of the responses to these inquiries can be found on our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page. Most questions can be answered by simply reviewing or searching a topic, such as GRE, TOEFL, official transcripts, personal statement, letters of recommendation and document status on the above webpages.\nIn the rare instance when a question is not answered on one of the above webpages or in the general response below, a personalized email response may be provided. As a courtesy, please do not send the same question to multiple staff/faculty throughout the CS Department. Please send your question that is not listed on the Grad FAQ webpage to the CS Grad Student Affairs Office only. As noted in the above webpages, applicants are asked not to make email or phone inquiries about the receipt of documents. Doing so will delay our efforts to process application materials.\nCriteria for Admission\nBachelor's Degree\nThe general requirement for admission for a U.S. student is a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution, comparable in standard and content to a bachelor’s degree from the University of California. Applicants should have the necessary academic preparation to complete graduate level courses in Computer Science.\nDegrees which are not considered comparable include those granted on the basis of work completed at institutions which are not fully accredited and those granted on the basis of nonacademic prior learning, test scores, or other than organized supervised coursework in academic subjects.\nAn international student whose post-secondary education is completed outside of the U.S. is expected to hold a degree representing completion of at least four years of study with above average/very good scholarship from a university or university-level institution.\nEnglish Proficiency\nInternational applicants must meet the university’s minimum requirement for the TOEFL or IELTS. Please visit this page for detailed information. Conditional admission is not offered and a transitional or pre-master’s program is not available.\nGrade Point Average (GPA)\nThe university requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 for consideration. The department reviews all applicants who have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. The most competitive applicants have an undergraduate cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 (on a 4.00 scale),and at least a 3.50 in any graduate study. The average cumulative GPA of admitted applicants is 3.60.\nStaff in the Computer Science Graduate Student Affairs Office review and convert, as necessary, the marks or grades of all applicants. The Graduate Division online application asks applicants to submit their grade point average on the scale used by their institutions.\nThe department does not provide “pre-application” reviews. Prospective applicants should review this page, frequently asked questions, and the department’s annual report to determine their admission competitiveness, and academic and research fit with the university.\nDeciding Between the CS PhD and MS Programs\nStudents may apply for either the Ph.D. program or the M.S. program but not both. Admission to the Ph.D. program is more selective than for the M.S. program. In general, the admissions committee does not consider Ph.D. applicants for admission into the M.S. program and vice versa. While a Ph.D. degree prepares students not only for careers in research and academia, those who apply for a Ph.D. degree typically demonstrate significant achievement in and/or potential for advancing knowledge through independent research and teaching.\nWhile a M.S. degree prepares students not only for careers in the industry, those who apply for an M.S degree typically demonstrate interest in developing and applying technical skills and translational knowledge. M.S. applicants should be aware that the selection process is rigorous for M.S. students who later apply for admission into the Ph.D. program.\nApplicants who hold a master’s degree in computer science or a closely related discipline will not be considered for admission to the master’s program. Applicants who hold only a bachelor’s degree may apply to the Ph.D. program. In recent years, the majority of PhD admittees have completed only a bachelor’s degree.\nApplication Requirements\nTo apply for the Computer Science PhD or MS program, submit the UCLA application for graduate admission and select Computer Science MS or Computer Science PhD as your intended program of study.\nThe deadline to submit an application for admission is DECEMBER 15, 23:59, Pacific Time. Students are admitted only once a year to start in the Fall quarter only. Applications should be submitted only between mid-September and December 15.\nFor more information about applying for graduate admission to UCLA, visit the Division of Graduate Education’s webpage.\n(1) Letters of Recommendation\nAt least THREE (3) letters of recommendation must be submitted using the graduate application link above. You will be asked to enter the names and emails of your recommenders in the application. They will then receive a link to submit their recommendations.\nFor M.S. applicants: We recommend that you provide letters of reference from professors who have taught you in your junior and senior years.\nIf you are an ESAP applicant to the CS MS program, you will need two letters of rec from CS faculty/instructors or instructors from outside the department that have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept (i.e. Professors Achuta Kadambi and Mani Srivastava are ECE faculty with joint appointments with the CS Dept). If the faculty member does not have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept they cannot serve as one of your two letters of rec for the CS M program as an ESAP applicant.\nFor Ph.D. applicants: We urge that all your letters be from academic or professional references as recent as possible and from people who can comment on your recent professional accomplishments and your qualifications for graduate study in Computer Science.

You can start on your capstone project earlier however you cannot submit the official capstone results form + abstract until you have completed all of your coursework and have Advanced to Candidacy first.\nM.S. Capstone Project Guidelines : We discourage MS capstone and MS thesis projects, in the flavor of simply assisting in instructional development activities such as revamping homework assignments, projects, tutorials, etc on behalf of faculty. To justify CS education research contributions, such projects must demonstrate the rigor of a systematic method and empirical data collection and analysis in the field of education.\nM.S. Capstone Examples: (this is for example purposes only so MS students are aware of the length and scope a capstone project).\nExample 1\nExample 2\nM.S. CAPSTONE PROJECT RESULTS: The Capstone Results Form can only be submitted if you have successfully Advanced to Candidacy (i.e. received an email from Academic Services stating you have Advanced to Candidacy). Results must be submitted to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office no later than Friday of finals week of the quarter in which the M.S. degree is to be awarded. See the Graduate Program Deadlines (found here) for specific dates. Requirements for the Capstone Plan II results form is available at here.\nM.S. Advancement To Candidacy (ATC) and Filing Fee\nThe Petition for Advancement to Master’s Candidacy (ATC form which is included in the ATC packet) must be submitted to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office (GSAO) in the quarter prior (you must be registered and enrolled and in good academic standing, i.e., GPA 3.0 and above in the quarter you are submitting the ATC packet) to when the student plans to be either on Filing Fee, or be registered and enrolled, and submitting the Capstone Project or M.S. Thesis. Please submit the ATC packet to the CS Grad Office no later than the end of 2nd week of the quarter you plan to Advance to Candidacy. Students must have completed or about to complete the Program of Study when they Advance to Candidacy.\nInstructions on submitting the ATC packet can be found on the CS Grad Notices MS section. You submit the ATC packet the quarter you are completing all of your coursework (do not submit it prior to that).\nA student must file the applicable Master’s Advancement to Candidacy packet with their major department no later than the Friday of second week of the quarter in which they plan to Advance to Candidacy (ATC).\nIf you are planning to ATC in the Summer you must be registered and enrolled in a course for 4 units during a summer session (A, B or C). You cannot drop this course at anytime.\nGSAO staff will verify course completion and grades at the end of the quarter. M.S. candidates have one calendar year from the date of advancement to candidacy in which to complete all requirements for the degree. If additional time is required, the student is responsible to resubmit their ATC packet by the deadline. Sample for the Advancement to Candidacy form can be found on the CS Grad Notices MS section.\nFor those finishing in Summer, in order to submit your capstone results form with all the signatures and abstract or uploading your thesis, you must be registered and enrolled for a minimum of 4 units or on filing fee.\nMaster’s Filing Fee\nWhen students have completed all requirements for the M.S. degree (except the filing of either the Thesis or Capstone Project) and have Advanced to Candidacy, they are eligible to pay a Filing Fee during the quarter in which the degree is to be awarded instead of registering. Filing Fee is entirely optional. You must be registered and enrolled the quarter you plan to submit your Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) packet (hence most students submit the ATC packet the quarter prior to the one they plan to be on Filing fee). You cannot ATC nor take classes the same quarter you plan to be on filing fee.\nStudents who plan to go on filing fee must have already have secured their advisor + committee members and have already begun worked on their capstone/thesis project the quarter prior to going on filing fee.\nStudents may only use Filing Fee for one quarter. Many services are suspended while on Filing Fee including but not limited to access to the UCLA VPN and online services among other services. Please visit the Filing Fee website for more information. Therefore if you need access to University resources, students should register and enroll and not apply for Filing Fee. If you are on Filing Fee and will not finish that same quarter you are on Filing Fee, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu before week 10 of the quarter you are on Filing Fee.  If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their thesis or Capstone Project by Friday at the end of finals week (this includes procuring your advisor and committee signatures), they will need to apply for readmission into the CS MS program (no exceptions) and note readmission is not guaranteed.\nThe Master’s Filing Fee application (and deadline to submit the Filing Fee application) can be found on HERE. For Summer and Fall, the deadline is 10 business days prior to the last day of Summer Session C (except if the deadline falls on Labor Day; in these cases the deadline will be 9 business days). Information and instructions for completing the Master’s Filing Fee application for the current quarter are available at https://www.cs.ucla.edu/graduate-office-newsletter/\nM.S. Progress Requirements (Time To Degree)\nFriendly reminder: only formally admitted M.S. students who applied for the M.S. program during admissions are allowed to obtain a degree in the CS M.S. program.\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, M.S. students must reach the milestones as established in the degree requirements outlined above, namely:\nProgram of Study: Should finish half if not more by the end of their first year in the MS program\nPetition for ATC: 2nd week of the quarter the comprehensive examination or thesis is being submitted\nThe maximum time to satisfactorily complete all M.S. requirements is 2 years or 6 quarters. Each quarter, the HSSEAS Dean’s Office evaluates the academic progress of all M.S. students. The majority of students are making satisfactory academic progress. Students not making satisfactory academic progress are notified and given corrective steps and time frames which will enable them to attain satisfactory academic progress.\nMS students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units. If you have further questions regarding this, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here). In addition to the standard reasons noted above, M.S. students may be recommended for termination for the following:\nFailure to maintain satisfactory progress toward the degree within the two-year time limit for completing all degree requirements.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in all courses and in those in the 200 series.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in any two consecutive terms.\nFailure of the comprehensive examination.\nFailure to complete the thesis to the satisfaction of the committee members.\nM.S. Students Applying To Ph.D. Program\nThe selection of M.S. students who apply for admission into the Ph.D. program is a rigorous, internal process that identifies candidates who have demonstrated academic and research potential and achievement. The following application materials must be submitted to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office (helen@cs.ucla.edu) during the last term of full-time enrollment.\nStatement of purpose: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nApplication for Admission to Ph.D. Program: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nMajor/Classification Change Petition: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment. Fill out the top half of the form. Under “Supplemental Information,” select the appropriate petition type. The department will take care of the memo on your behalf. You do not need to obtain the memo yourself.\nLetter of Recommendation: Statement from faculty advisor recommending admission and guaranteeing funding support for duration of graduate study and research. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. Without the CS Faculty Advisor putting this in writing and giving it to the CS Student Grad Office, the student is unable to transition into the Ph.D. program.\nLetter of Recommendation Forms from faculty advisor and two other CS faculty. All must have evaluated either the student’s Capstone Project or Thesis. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. The deadline for filing the M.S. thesis with the Young Research Library is Week 7 of the quarter. The deadline for filing the Capstone Project results with the CS Graduate Student Affair Office is also Week 7 of the quarter, which is 3 weeks earlier than the regular due date, to accommodate the processing and review of the application to the Ph.D. program. If all documents are submitted on or before the deadlines noted above and admission is offered, the effective term for classification as a Ph.D. student would be the term following the completion of all requirements for the M.S. degree, which includes submission of the M.S. thesis or Capstone Project.\nNOTE:\nFailure to submit each document by the deadline will cancel consideration of the internal M.S. to Ph.D. application. Students would then need to apply through the regular graduate application.\nStudents on filing fee during their last quarter may not apply using the above process. Students would instead need to reapply through the regular graduate application for admission. Please notify the Graduate Student Affairs Office when your application is submitted.\nDoctoral Program\nFields of Study\nArtificial Intelligence\nComputational Systems Biology\nComputer Science Theory\nComputer System Architecture\nData Science Computing\nGraphics and Vision\nNetwork Systems\nSoftware Systems\nDegree Requirements\nNormally, Ph.D. students take courses to acquire the knowledge needed to prepare for the written and oral preliminary examinations and for conducting research. The basic program of study is built around the following:\nWritten Qualifying Examination (WQE)\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement (3 quarters)\nProposal of Fields (POF)\nAd-hoc Checklist (if applicable)\nOral Qualifying Examination (OQE) and Advancement to Candidacy (ATC)\nFinal Oral Examination on the Dissertation (Final Defense)\nFiling the Doctoral Dissertation\nAcademic Progress Requirements (Time-to-Degree)\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, Ph.D. students must reach the degree milestones by the following deadlines:\nWritten Qualifying Exam:  End of 2nd year (6th quarter)\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter)\nProposal of Fields:  End of 3rd Year (9th quarter)\nOral Qualifying Exam:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter) Missing this OQE milestone by the 9th quarter will result in an Unsatisfactory outcome in the PhD progress report.\nFinal Defense:  End of 6th year (18th quarter)\nThe expected time to graduation of 6 years (18 quarters) accords with Graduate Division rules, which limit students to a maximum of 12 quarters as a teaching assistant and a maximum of 18 quarters combined as either a teaching assistant or research assistant.\nEach year at the end of spring quarter the entire faculty evaluates the academic progress of all Ph.D. students. A summary of each evaluation is sent by email to all students and their faculty advisors. These notifications indicate if the academic progress of students has been satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  By default the evaluations work as follows, but outcomes can differ based on the faculty discussion:\nA student who has completed all milestones that are required based on their length of time in the program receives an evaluation of “satisfactory progress.”\nA student who fails to meet one of the above deadlines for the first time receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress.”The student is typically given six months to complete the milestone and is re-evaluated at that point.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress” receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal.”  The student is typically given six more months to complete the milestone and is notified that they are subject to dismissal from the Ph.D. program if this deadline is not met.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” will be discussed by the faculty.  Based on input from the student’s faculty advisor and other information, the faculty may vote to dismiss the student from the Ph.D. program, or they may decide to give the student one more chance and send another “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” letter. An “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” evaluation may also affect a student’s eligibility for a TA assignment.\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00 or if the student’s work in any two consecutive terms fall below a 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here).\nWritten Qualifying Exam (WQE)\nThe written qualifying examination (WQE) is the preliminary written examination for all Computer Science Ph.D. students in the Fall and Spring quarters only. The WQE consists of a high-quality paper, solely written by the student. The paper can be either a research paper containing an original contribution, or a focused critical survey paper. The paper should demonstrate the student’s understanding of the subject area, as well as their ability to integrate and communicate ideas clearly and concisely. To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the WQE no later than their 2nd year (6th quarter) of enrollment. Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the WQE. Review the WQE requirements, submission procedures and deadlines.\nLENGTH: Maximum of 10 single-spaced pages. The entire document, including references, figures, tables, appendices, and any other type of material, must fit within the ten pages. The co-author acknowledgement form is not part of the 10 pages.\nSTYLE: Suitable for submission to a first-rate technical conference or journal.\nCONTENT RESTRICTIONS: The paper must represent work that the student did as a graduate student at UCLA. Students must explicitly acknowledge in detail any contributions, including those of their faculty advisor, that are not their own. Any contributions to the paper that are not the student’s, including those of their advisor, must be explicitly acknowledged in detail. Specifically, on the first page of the WQE paper, in a separate paragraph at the end of the abstract, the student is required to specify, in detail, which parts of the paper represent the student’s own intellectual contributions. The student must have to color code contributions and attach a student co-author acknowledgement form. Any parts of the paper that are the contributions of others, including the advisor(s), must also be explicitly acknowledged in detail. There must be a separate sentence detailing the advisor’s contribution to the research and paper. In addition, there must be a different sentence describing the contributions of each co-author of the paper, if any.\nPREPARATION: An individual studies class, CS597B: Preparation for Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit course work requirement each quarter.\nSUBMISSION PROCESS: The paper must first be approved for submission by the student’s faculty advisor. Their signature on the WQE Cover Page is proof of approval. The WQE Cover Page then must be turned in to the Graduate Student Affairs Office at helen@cs.ucla.edu by the posted deadline. There are two deadlines a year for submission of papers, one in the fall quarter and the other in the spring quarter. Students are emailed a WQE announcement including dates and instructions after the start of the fall and the winter quarters.\nREVIEW PROCESS: After submission, the WQE will be reviewed by at least two other members of the faculty. Students will receive via email an evaluation and whether or not they have passed the WQE.NOTE: Ph.D. students who want to receive a master’s degree along the way may substitute a passing WQE for the master’s comprehensive examination.\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement\nPhD students must complete at least three quarters of Computer Science 201 with grades of Satisfactory (in addition to the three quarters of CS 201 that may have been completed for the M.S. degree).\nCompletion of the seminars will be reviewed when students submit the Proposal of Fields form.\nStudents who plan to add the CS MS degree along the way must complete six quarters of COM SCI 201 with an ‘S’ grade.\nProposal of Fields (POF)\nThe Proposal of Fields (POF) consists of one major field and two minor fields. The major field and at least one minor field must be in computer science. All major and minor field courses must be taken for a letter grade. To satisfy the major field requirement, students are expected to attain a body of knowledge contained in five courses, as well as the current literature in the area of specialization. In particular, students are required to take a minimum of three graduate courses in the major field of Ph.D. research, selecting these courses in accordance with guidelines specific to the major field. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses used to satisfy the major field requirement, are required. Students are required to satisfy the major field requirement by the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment and before taking the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). Each minor field normally embraces a body of knowledge equivalent to two courses, at least one of which is a graduate course. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses included in the minor field, are required. At least one minor field must be in computer science. Both minors must be completed prior to the OQE.\nSTANDARD PROPOSALS: Refer to the Proposal of Fields Guidelines for composing major and minor proposals in established fields. If the courses in a major or a minor field proposal adhere to these guidelines, the field will not require the signature of the corresponding field chair. The established fields are as follows: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Systems Biology, Computer System Architecture, Computer Science Theory, Data Science Computing, Graphics and Vision, Network Systems, and Software Systems.\nPROPOSALS WITH ONE OR MORE COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS: A major or a minor field proposal in an established field that deviates from the standard guidelines by one or more course substitutions must be approved by the corresponding field chair (who may consult with faculty in the field). The list of current Field Chairs is available on the last page of the Proposal of Fields Guidelines.\nTo submit a petition for a course not listed, send a separate email for each course requiring a petition to the field chair to review. Copy helen@cs.ucla.edu in each email. Include a brief justification for the substitution. Include the course syllabus and a transcript with the class marked or highlighted so the certifying instructor can quickly confirm.\nCOURSE WORK TAKEN AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS: No more than three equivalent or related graduate courses taken at other institutions may be applied to the major or minor field requirements, subject to the following:\nIf a course taken at another institution is included in a major or minor field proposal, and falls within an established field, the proposal will be considered a deviation from the standard guidelines and must be approved by the corresponding field chair.\nThe graduate course must be taken while a graduate student.\nThe graduate course cannot have been applied toward an undergraduate degree.\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL: A major or minor field proposal that does not fall in one of the established fields is considered an ad-hoc field proposal. Guidelines for consideration follow:\nThe department must approve all proposals for an ad-hoc field. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their ad-hoc proposal for approval BEFORE taking any of the proposed courses.\nThe ad-hoc field should be a coherent set of courses in an identifiable area (body of knowledge) that is not a subfield of the area of the major or the minors. The ad-hoc field should provide a perspective that is different from the other fields. It cannot merely be a collection of three useful classes.\nIf the ad-hoc field presents some overlap with topics that are generally associated with the other fields, the student must provide a justification that carefully explains why this overlap does not impinge on the value of the minor to broadening the academic experience. (If the Academic Policy Committee [APC] finds such an overlap, the students may be required to provide more information.)\nAd-hoc minor cannot include courses that are listed either as core or ancillary of other proposed major and minor. For example, a proposal with the DSC major cannot include any courses listed in the DSC core and ancillary lists in the ad-hoc minor.\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL SUBMISSION & APPROVAL PROCEDURES: The proposal for an ad-hoc field must be included in a completed Proposal of Fields and must be submitted together with a detailed, written justification explaining how the proposed ad-hoc field meets the requirements above and supports a research area. Include details on the proposed classes for the field (course description and/or course syllabus for each class). Email a copy of the completed Proposal of Fields to Helen Tran by Friday of Week 5. Refer to list of current Field Chairs. The subject line should read “Proposal for Ad-Hoc Field”. Approval of an ad-hoc field proposal requires a majority vote of the Academic Policy Committee (APC). The APC Chair, on behalf of the committee, will inform students and the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office by email when a decision is reached.\nThe POF form, guidelines, and procedures are available here: Proposal of Fields.\nAdding an MS Degree Along the Way\nCS Ph.D. students who have not earned previously a master’s in computer science, electrical engineering, or similar discipline AND have not advanced to candidacy for the PhD may be awarded an MS degree while working toward the PhD degree by fulfilling all the MS degree requirements. The MS degree and PhD degree may not be conferred in the same quarter, so the process should begin no later than the term in which the MS degree requirements are fulfilled. Students should confer with their faculty advisor about whether they should do a Thesis (Master’s Plan I) or a Capstone Plan (Master’s Plan II). A passed Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) may be substituted for the Capstone Project in Plan II.\nREQUIRED FORMS:\nComplete the Advancement to Candidacy Petition. Use instructions on page 1 of this form to fill out the ATC petition. Only the student signature is required. The Grad Office will approve and sign the ATC form.\nDownload a copy of your unofficial transcript and highlight the 9 courses used toward the MS Program of Study. Then merge the transcripts starting on page 2 of the ATC petition. #1 and #2 should be one, single PDF file. Rename this file to “MS, Yourlastname YourUID” (i.e. MS, Bruin 123456789).\nPhD adding MS Degree form (page 2) and Proposed MS Program Study (page 3). If you are taking the WQE in the same quarter you are adding the MS degree, enter the quarter you are taking the WQE. If CS 201 or any other courses are currently in progress in the quarter you are adding the MS degree, mark the grade as “TBD.” We will take care of the necessary signatures. Rename this file to “Your Name PhDAddingMS” (i.e. Joe Bruin PhDAddingMS).\nM.S. Capstone Project Results Form (if Plan II is chosen). If applicable, please note on this form that If the WQE is being substituted for the Capstone Project. Committee signatures should be left blank since you are PhD student using the WQE instead. Rename this file to “Your Name MS Capstone Form” (i.e. Joe Bruin Capstone Form).\nDEADLINE:Submit all materials to  Helen Tran no later than Friday of Week 2 of the quarter in which the MS degree is to be awarded. If all documents and the thesis or comprehensive examination are submitted according to deadlines, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nFAQ:\nDo I need to pass the WQE before adding the MS degree? No, you may take the WQE in the same quarter you want to add the MS degree. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the WQE. Students may indicate on the required MS forms above that the WQE is currently in progress.\nDo I need to finish 9 courses and six CS 201s a quarter before adding the MS degree? No, you may take your remaining courses in-progress and add the MS degree in the same quarter. Students must show they are enrolled in the last course(s) needed to complete the MS program of study. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the final course(s). Students may indicate on the required MS forms above which course(s) are currently in progress.\nAre the course requirements the same for the CS MS and PhD degrees? While both degrees require 9 courses and the 9 courses may (often do) overlap, students should ensure they are satisfying both requirements separately. The MS degree requires a certain number of 200-level CS courses and electives within CS or Engineering. While the Proposal of Fields may allow graduate course substitutions from other universities or other departments, the MS degree does not. Therefore, students are encouraged to review both sets of requirements to ensure their course selections satisfy both degrees. The MS degree requires students to take their 9 courses as a graduate student at UCLA.\nI don’t plan to advance to candidacy (ATC) or do my Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE) yet. When should I add the MS degree? The master’s ATC and the doctoral ATC are two separate procedures. The master’s ATC (if students wish to add the MS degree) must occur before the doctoral ATC. To ATC for the master’s degree, PhD students typically take six CS 201s, complete the MS program of study, and the WQE. Students should add the MS degree in the quarter they are taking their last MS course requirement(s) and/or WQE. To ATC for the doctoral degree, PhD students must finish their Proposal of Fields and pass the Oral Qualifying Exam.\nMay I add the MS degree and do my OQE in the same quarter? Yes, as long as 1) the required forms for the master’s ATC are submitted by Friday of Week 2 and 2) you have completed the PhD Proposal of Fields, you may add the MS degree and do the OQE in the same quarter if necessary. The university policy is that the MS ATC must occur the PhD ATC. The official MS ATC confirmation email is typically sent to students during the middle of the quarter. Thus, students who wish to do the OQE in the same quarter are encouraged to schedule the OQE in the second half of the quarter so that the PhD ATC occurs after.\nOral Qualifying Exam (OQE) & Advancement To Candidacy (ATC)\nOQE MILESTONE: After passing the WQE, students should form a doctoral committee and prepare to take the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the OQE no later than the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment. The nature and content of the OQE are at the discretion of the doctoral committee, but generally the student gives a talk, followed by questions from the faculty.\nENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT: Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the OQE. If students take the OQE in the summer, they must have been enrolled in at least 12 units in the preceding Spring quarter.\nADDING AN MS DEGREE ALONG THE WAY: PhD students who have not previously earned a master’s degree may add the MS degree in CS along the way. Students must submit a petition to add the MS degree before the OQE can be held. The MS degree cannot be added after the OQE. Additional instructions can be found in the “Adding an MS Degree Along the Way” section above.\nNOMINATING A DOCTORAL COMMITTEE: The Division of Graduate Education must approve the doctoral committee before the OQE can be held.\nHOW TO PREPARE: Students should familiarize themselves with the regulations for the doctoral qualifying examinations detailed in the Standards & Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (pages 15-18).\nORAL QUALIFYING EXAM – CHECKLIST REQUIREMENTS (DUE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CAN GO FORWARD)\n3 quarters of COM SCI 201 Seminars with ‘S’ grades only.

If the student requests it or agrees to a request from the committee chair or cochairs, non-UCLA faculty or external subject matter experts serving on doctoral committees may participate remotely in oral qualifying examinations and final defenses with the approval of the committee chair or co-chairs. Requests for the remote participation of the student or UCLA faculty require special approval from the Chair or Vice Chair of Graduate Studies. Approval may be granted for the following reasons: health reasons, UCLA faculty on sabbatical or on leave, or travelling off campus for research purposes such as attending conferences.\nReport the committee member(s) participating remotely using the Remote Participation and Exception Request Form.\nAfter obtaining the committee chair’s signature, email the form to  Helen Tran for review with the Graduate Vice Chair for approval.\nSCHEDULE A ROOM (4 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nCoordinate with your committee to find a date and time that will work for all of them\nConference room reservation requests may be submitted online. Request will be processed within 7 days. Room reservations submissions will be prioritized by the order received. Once your reservation has been made, it will be pending until approved. Once approved, you will receive an email from Jade Hill through your email associated with your login (@cs.ucla.edu).\nSUBMIT PROSPECTUS TO DOCTORAL COMMITTEE (2 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nEmail or deliver your prospectus to each of your committee members\nEmail  Helen Tran and include the following information:\nOQE date, time, and location\nAttach a copy of your prospectus\nConfirm if you A) are adding the MS along the way B) have already added the CS MS degree C) do not plan to add the CS MS degree or D) already obtained a MS degree.\nAFTER YOU COMPLETE YOUR QUALS, the doctoral committee chair submits the Report on Oral Qualifying Exam to CS Graduate Student Affairs Office. Once the report is processed, you will be charged fees that total $90 (for your Candidacy for Doctoral Degree). We suggest you check your BruinBill 10-15 days after you complete your OQE.\nDue to various University Policies, failure to complete these steps without their allotted lead time (6 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 weeks prior to your scheduled exam) may result in requiring you to reschedule your exam.\nAn individual studies class, CS597C: Preparation for Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit requirement each quarter.\nNRST WAIVER: Beginning the quarter immediately after the OQE is passed, non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST) is waived for up to nine quarters. If nine quarters pass without the filing of the dissertation, non-resident tuition charges are reinstituted.\nDoctoral Dissertation and Filing Fee\nAfter successfully completing the final defense, students are expected to soon be ready to file their dissertation. Students must follow the official UCLA manuscript preparation guide for Thesis and Dissertation Filing Requirements.  All Ph.D. students expecting to graduate in a given quarter are strongly encouraged to attend a dissertation filing workshop scheduled at the beginning of each quarter at the Charles E. Young Research Library.\nDOCTORAL FILING FEE: In the term that students intend to file their dissertation, they may apply for Filing Fee instead of enrolling for courses on the condition that they are completing only their dissertation. Filing fee status may be applied only for one quarter. If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their dissertation by the filing deadline, they must retroactively enroll and pay fees for that quarter. Information and instruction for completing the doctoral Filing Fee application and the Filing Fee application are available here. In approximately 10 business days, students should review their Bruin Bill account for a posting of a charge of $201 for the doctoral Filing Fee. Approximately 5 business days after fee payment, the filing date is posted on the transcript. If filed by the term’s dissertation deadline, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nDeadlines are posted in the Resources for Students page.\nFinal Defense Checklist\n(OPTIONAL) RECONSTITUTE your doctoral committee (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nIf you need to add or change a committee member: Complete the RECONSTITUTION OF COMMITTEE FORM.

A student must be registered in order to take any University examination with the exception of those that are permitted by payment of the Filing Fee (master’s comprehensive exam or doctoral final defense.) Students must be registered during the regular academic quarter when they take the written and oral qualifying examinations for the doctorate. To be eligible to take such examinations in the summer, the student must have been registered in the immediately preceding Spring term.\nThree regular courses (or 12 units) per term are considered the normal enrollment for graduate students. All computer science graduate students must be enrolled in at least 12 units each regular quarter (Fall, Winter, and Spring) to maintain full-time student status. Students are responsible for checking their study list on MyUCLA prior to the third week of classes to ensure that they have enrolled in the sufficient number of units and the correct courses. CS students are subject to dismissal from the program if not enrolled full-time, on leave of absence, or on Filing Fee status.\nEnrollment appointments are published on the Registrar’s Office webpage at: http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/soc/enrollappt.htm\nEnrollment in upper-division undergrad courses (100-level courses) begin after the date of the “Second Pass”. (Students may override warnings about unmet prerequisite courses by clicking the box below the prompt.)\nIndividual Studies Classes are offered for variable units and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit course work requirement each quarter. Enrollment must be pre-approved by students’ faculty advisors.\nAdditional University and Graduate Program Deadlines can be found at the Resources for Students page.\nSEAS Café\nThe Henry Samuel School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) has a small student-run snack shop located in 5800 Boelter Hall. Students may purchase sandwiches, beverages, and snacks. The SEAS Café is a cash-only establishment.\nTeaching Apprenticeships (TAships)\nTeaching apprenticeships (TA-ships) are available on a limited basis depending on enrollment in undergraduate courses and budgetary considerations in the university, School of Engineering, and department. To be eligible for a TA-ship, students must meet the following requirements:\nCS PH.D. DEGREE OBJECTIVE: PhD students could earn the opportunity to TA as they make satisfactory progress through the PhD program. Though the funding offer letter says that they are funded as GSRs from their advisor(s), satisfactory PhD students are allowed and encouraged to serve as a TA generally once per year after their first year.\nOnly PhD students are considered for TA-ships. They are required to satisfy a teaching requirement (at least one quarter) as part of their departmental PhD degree requirements, or provide documentation of equivalent experience. PhD students should contact Helen Tran at helen@cs.ucla.edu, if they believe that have equivalent teaching experience.\nM.S. applicants are not eligible for departmental financial support.\nTAing/GSRs/Reader positions are not part of the Computer Science MS program curriculum, and MS students (both incoming and continuing) are not guaranteed TAships/GSRs/Reader positions (i.e. Dept funding) for any year.\nInternational M.S. applicants must demonstrate personal or agency financial support of at least $63,713 for the first year to qualify for a visa to study in the U.S. Prospective international M.S. applicants should apply for admission ONLY if they can provide such documentation, which will be requested if admission is offered, in early March. Information on the cost of attendance is available on the UCLA Graduate Division webpage. Specific charges for tuition and fees and non-resident supplemental tuition are listed on the Registrar’s fee page.\nTherefore, prospective M.S. students are aware upon applying that if they are admitted they must demonstrate they have the financial support for our program. Proof of this financial support is also requested when an M.S student is admitted into our M.S program and submit their Confidential Financial Statement (CFS) in order to verify evidence/proof of financial support and issuance of a UCLA I-20.\nCS 495: TEACHING ASSISTANT TRAINING SEMINAR: Graduate students must pass CS495: Teaching Assistant Training Seminar to be eligible for TA-ships. In rare instance, with prior approval, the class may be taken concurrently with the first TAship. The class is offered each year only during Fall quarter.\nFULL-TIME ENROLLMENT: TAs must be registered and enrolled in a minimum of 12 units by the end of the third week of the quarter of their appointment or their benefits (fee remissions and health insurance) will be cancelled.\nGRADE POINT AVERAGE: CS TAs must have at least a 3.25 GPA at the time of their employment.\nTEST OF ORAL PROFICIENCY (TOP): To be eligible for a TAship, graduate students whose first language is not English are required to take the TOP. Please review the TOP section below for more information on the CS policy.\nApplications for TAships are emailed to all Ph.D. students in May with an application deadline in June. Applicants who receive a tentative assignment for the next academic school year will be contacted with more information. In addition to the general requirements outlined above, TA assignments are determined by instructor preferences, advancement to candidacy, academic standing, student qualifications, funding obligations, and student preferences/qualifications/experience.\nIn addition to a salary, students who are assigned a TAship of 25% or higher, also receive fee remissions.\nFee remissions do not cover all graduate student fees. It is the responsibility of graduate students to ensure that those additional fees (non-remissible fees), are paid by the applicable Graduate Program Deadlines (listed at the Resources for Students page).\nInternational Students\nEnglish as a Second Language Placement Exam (ESLPE)\nInternational graduate students need to take the ESLPE if their native language is not English, their TOEFL-IBT score is under 100 (or their IELTS score is below 7.5), and their application shows that they do not have a previous degree from a university where English is the medium of instruction and in an English-speaking country.\nStudents should take the ESLPE before the 1st quarter (summer). If students cannot take the exam in the summer, they may take the exam during the Fall in Week 2. The ESLPE test dates can be found on the ESLPE website. The exam will be offered up to 4 times in summer and in Week 2 of Fall quarter. There will be no exams offered in Winter or Spring.\nFailure to take the ESLPE in the first quarter will result in a hold on your MyUCLA records.\nTest of Oral Proficiency (TOP)\nAll graduate students at UCLA who are i) non-US citizens, ii) do not hold a bachelor’s degree from an institution where English was the medium of communication, and iii) wish to be TA’s, must first take the TEST OF ORAL PROFICIENCY (TOP) and earn a provisional passing score (6.4 – 7.0) to become eligible to be a TA. The Computer Science Department has a higher standard, requiring students to earn a clear passing score of 7.1 or higher. Effective Spring 2026, CS PhD students with a Provisional Pass TOP score (6.4–7.0) are eligible for TA roles that do not include the responsibility of teaching a discussion section. A Clear Pass TOP score (7.1 or higher) is required for TA roles that include the responsibility of teaching a discussion section. Achieving the necessary TOP score must occur before TA appointment prior to the quarter that a student would like to TA. As such, we recommend students take the TOP as soon as possible once they enter UCLA.\nNon-Passing (0.0 – 6.3):  Student is not permitted to TA and must take an approved ESL course for international TAs (310, 311, 312, or 313) before retaking the exam. The student may retake the exam while enrolled in the course.\nProvisional Pass (6.4 – 7.0):  Student is required to take a full 10-week approved ESL course for international TAs (ESL 310, 311, 312 or 313) before the first quarter of TA work. If the student successfully completes the ESL course with a passing grade, the student may serve as a TA without further testing or coursework. If the student does not pass the required ESL course, the student must take a second approved ESL course in a subsequent quarter and receive a passing grade in order to serve as TA. NOTE: If a student has fully or partially completed an approved course prior to receiving a marginal pass, this course is considered preparatory and does not satisfy the TOP requirement for a marginal pass. The TA must take another approved ESL course first.\nCS students who receive a Provisional Pass must enroll in an ESL oral skills course and then retake the exam with a 7.1 score or higher in order to be offered a CS TA position.Clear Pass (7.1 – 10): The student is permitted to TA with no restrictions. Test takers who receive a clear pass are not permitted to retake the exam.\nExemptions:A student is exempt from taking the TOP if they have earned a prior undergraduate degree from an institution at which English was the sole language of instruction and which is located in a country where English is the primary spoken language of everyday life.\nAs of Fall 2024, an exemption is also granted to students who have a valid TOEFL-iBT speaking score of 28 or higher or an IELTS speaking score of 8.5 or higher.\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT)\nF1 international graduate students interested in CPT should review the CPT Guidelines on the Dashew Center’s website for more information.\nMS StudentsMS students must enroll in a COM SCI 596 course. Request permission to enroll in CS 596 from the faculty advisor prior to enrolling. For Summer CPT, request permission to enroll in 596 from the faculty advisor. Forward the email approval to Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu who will manually enroll you in the course.\nPhD Students\nwho HAVE NOT advanced to candidacy: The Department of Computer Science requires international PhD students to obtain prior approval from their faculty advisor using the CS CPT Approval Form before enrolling in a 500-level course (typically 596) and applying for CPT. Please submit the approval form with the advisor’s signature to deeval@cs.ucla.edu who will review it with the Graduate Vice Chair. For Summer CPT, email the form to deeval@cs.ucla.edu, and she will provide 596 enrollment instructions.\nwho HAVE advanced to candidacy: The Department of Computer Science requires international PhD students to obtain prior approval from their faculty advisor using the CS CPT Approval Form before enrolling in a 500-level course (typically 596) and applying for CPT.

Now an assistant professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, Jain is one of 22 Sloan Computer Science Fellows chosen among faculty members throughout North America. The two-year, $75,000 fellowship honors the most promising scientific researchers working today.\n“Aayush’s research pushes the frontier in our understanding of some of the deepest questions in cryptography,” said Prof. Sahai, the Symantec Endowed Chair in Computer Science at UCLA.\nDuring his time at UCLA, Jain – together with Sahai and Huijia (Rachel) Lin of the University of Washington – solved a two-decade-old open problem by constructing the first indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) scheme based on well-studied security assumptions. The breakthrough, which Quanta Magazine described as achieving the “crown jewel” of cryptography, received the Best Paper Award at the 2021 ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC). Jain’s doctoral dissertation was subsequently honored with the 2022 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award for the best PhD thesis in computer science worldwide.\nA full list of 2026 Sloan Research Fellows is available here: https://sloan.org/fellowships/2026-Fellows",

This research impact award is presented annually to an individual or team whose pioneering software engineering research has moved the field in a new direction and influenced other researchers to build on their contribution.\nThe award committee cited Professor Kim’s leadership in data-driven software analytics and her work in establishing the significance of code clones in industrial software evolution. Her research challenged the long-held belief that “copy-and-paste” programming was purely detrimental. Instead, she demonstrated how recurring, duplicated code patterns could be analyzed to understand how software evolves, automate bug fixes, and streamline API updates.\nFor over two decades, Professor Kim and her team have provided crucial insights into how large-scale software systems evolve, stimulating new research directions in clone detection, AI-driven program repair, and the identification of similar bugs and security vulnerabilities. Her work in formalizing code regularity helped establish the principle that large-scale code repositories can be leveraged for code recommendation, refactoring, and automated repair—insights that inform the development of modern AI-driven developer tools.\nProfessor Kim is an ACM Distinguished Member and received the ACM SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award for outstanding achievements in mentoring with emphasis on research excellence in software engineering. Eight of her former students and postdocs are faculty members at institutions such as Columbia, Purdue, and Virginia Tech. She will formally accept the IEEE TCSE New Directions Award at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2026.",

I find it truly amazing that you simply blink and there’s an entirely new development that has come out of this field.”\nThe all-day symposium, presented by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activity, the DataX Initiative, the Institute for Digital Research & Education and the Office for Advanced Research Computing, allowed speakers from across campus to give their perspectives on the role of AI in academic research and question its impact through multiple lenses.\nThrough multidisciplinary panel discussions and lightning talks, they explored the fundamentals of intelligence and artificial intelligence, and covered topics including the use of AI in research to prevent homelessness, predict landslides and understand human genetic diseases. The final panel, “Data Justice,” focused on the current and potential harms and biases of AI and offered ideas on how to move forward responsibly with new technologies.\n“It was clearly the right time to bring together faculty and other academics doing cutting-edge (research) from across campus to educate one another on methods, tools and services that are available to the UCLA community,” said Susan Swarts, administrative director of DataX. “There was a lot of energy at all the sessions, and many valuable connections and reconnections were made throughout the day.”",
