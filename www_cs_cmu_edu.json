In particular, we do not issue waivers based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college or university. We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college or university outside of the United States. No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of the country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver.Some of our programs will accept expired test scores from applicants who have recently completed a degree in the United States if the applicant can present a copy of an official score report showing the applicant's picture, not an unofficial score listing. Please consult the information for each specific program you apply to.If, as described above, you are required to submit proof of English proficiency, your TOEFL, IELTS or Duolingo test scores will be considered valid as follows:If you have not received a bachelor's degree in the U.S., then you will need to submit an English proficiency score no older than two years. (Test scores taken before September 1, 2023, will not be accepted.)If you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or a master's degree in the U.S., then you may submit an expired test score up to five years old. (Test scores taken before September 1, 2020, will not be accepted.) ETS does not hold scores that are over two years old; in this case, you may upload a PDF of your expired score to your application. Be sure that the expired scores meet our requirements.If you are applying to MCDS and MHCI, then you are required to submit scores from an English proficiency exam taken within the last two years. Scores taken before September 1, 2023, will not be accepted regardless of whether you have previously studied in the U.S. For more information about their English proficiency score policies, visit the MCDS or MHCI admissions websites.TimingIf you need to take or retake one of these tests, we highly recommend that you take the exam no later than November 26, 2025.

We discourage the use of the \"TOEFL ITP Plus for China,\" since speaking is not scored. A successful applicant will typically have a total iBT score of at least 100. Send scores via ETS using our SCS/CMU codes:TOEFL Institution Code: 4256TOEFL Department Code: 78International English Language Testing System (IELTS)We prefer that you take the TOEFL, but we will accept the IELTS. An IELTS score of 7 is equivalent to a TOEFL score of 100. We accept IELTS scores through e-delivery; enter the information below when setting up your scores for delivery:Account Name: Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer ScienceAddress: School of Computer Science5000 Forbes AvenuePittsburgh, PA 15213 United StatesDuolingoWe prefer that you take the TOEFL or IELTS; if this isn't possible, then you may take the Duolingo test. Visit the Duolingo website to see a score comparison. For score delivery:Use the same email address as the one you plan to use when applying to a CMU program.Send Duolingo scores to \"Carnegie Mellon University – Graduate Computer Science Programs.\"Important: Make sure to request that Duolingo includes your subscores.Unofficial TranscriptsTranscripts must be uploaded prior to application submission. We do not require hard copies of your transcripts at the time of application; if you are accepted to a program, then you will be given instructions to mail your transcripts at that time.We do not require you to upload your fall semester grades. If your fall semester grades are not on your transcript by the application deadline, do not worry. They are not needed for the admissions review process, and we will not update your transcripts after you receive them. Since fall grades are not required, we recommend uploading your transcripts as early as possible.Resume / CVYou will be asked to submit your current resume. It should outline your education, research experience, work experience, publications, scholarships awarded, prizes and honors received, society memberships and any other extracurricular activities.Statement of PurposeEach program has specific requirements for the Statement of Purpose, detailed on the application.Generally: You should prepare a concise one- or two-page essay that describes your research interests, related experiences and objectives in pursuing a graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon.Your essay should be specific. Explain why your research interests are important areas of study and why you are particularly well-suited to pursue them.You should describe any relevant education, research, commercial, government or teaching experience.Our review committees value applicants who display persistence and resilience in the face of challenge and adversity, demonstrate a commitment to ethics, show concern for others and for their community, and/or exhibit leadership in one or more endeavors.We recommend that you use AI tools only in a limited fashion. They are great for correcting grammar and spelling; they are terrible for expressing your own interests and experiences.

Please consider carefully how you use these tools as the use of them may impact your ability to be admitted.Letters of RecommendationYou are required to submit three letters of recommendation. The application allows you to submit up to five; no more than five will be accepted. Letters of recommendation will be requested and submitted electronically.Selecting your recommendersRecommenders should know you relatively well and be able to evaluate the quality of your previous work. At least two letters should be from faculty or recent employers.The admissions committee wants to know about your ability to do independent research, so you should select letter writers who can speak best to this point.Professors who interacted with you extensively in smaller classes are also a good choice.Employers are sometimes appropriate, but letters that are simply character references will not provide good support for your application.TimingIf you submit your application early, your recommenders still have until the final deadline to submit their letters.If the application deadline is approaching, and one or more letters of recommendation are still pending, do not wait to submit your application. We prefer that your recommenders meet the deadline, but it is okay if the letters arrive a few days late.Video Essay / Digital PortfolioSome of our programs request a \"live\" video essay or prerecorded digital porfolio.For the video essay, you will record a 1- to 3-minute live video of yourself answering a random question we provide. This recording is done within the application system.For the digital portfolio, you will upload or provide a URL link to a 1- to 3-minute prerecorded video of yourself responding to a specific question or set of questions the program will provide.
