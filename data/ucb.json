  "description_for_vector_db": "[Program Nature] Berkeley's MS in EECS is a small, highly selective research-oriented program. It is often a stepping stone to a PhD, though it can be taken as a terminal degree. [Research Excellence] Students work in prestigious labs like BAIR (Berkeley AI Research) or the RISELab. The program is world-renowned for Systems, AI, and Theory. [Silicon Valley Synergy] Located next to the tech hub, Berkeley has deep ties with startups and giants alike. [Admission Insight] High emphasis on previous research publications and technical leadership. The committee looks for 'pioneers' who can push the boundaries of CS."
