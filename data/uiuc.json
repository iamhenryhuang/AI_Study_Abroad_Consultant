  "description_for_vector_db": "[Program Identity] The UIUC MS CS is a highly selective research-oriented degree. Unlike the professional MCS (Master of Computer Science), the MS CS requires a research thesis and is specifically designed for students aiming for advanced research roles or a future PhD. [Financial Support] A standout feature of this program is that most admitted students receive full financial support through research assistantships (RA) or teaching assistantships (TA). This support typically includes a full tuition waiver and a monthly living stipend, making it one of the most cost-effective elite CS programs. [Research Powerhouse] UIUC is world-renowned for its research in Systems, Parallel Computing, Distributed Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Mining. It is home to the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). [Admission Strategy] Admissions are very competitive; the committee prioritizes candidates with demonstrated research potential and strong technical foundations. It is highly recommended that applicants reach out to potential faculty advisors before or during the application process. [Language Policy] The program has a strict English proficiency requirement. Applicants with a TOEFL score between 79 and 102 may be admitted on a 'Limited Status,' requiring them to take English as a Second Language (ESL) placement tests upon arrival. [Career & Academic Pathways] Graduates often secure positions in elite corporate R&D labs or continue their doctoral studies at top-tier institutions."
