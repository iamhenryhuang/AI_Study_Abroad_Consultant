  "description_for_vector_db": "[Program Identity] The Cornell MS in CS is a 4-semester program that is fully funded. It is a research-intensive program where students serve as TAs or RAs. [Academic Excellence] Students have access to top-tier research in Ithaca and the Cornell Tech campus in NYC. [Path to PhD] Many MS students continue to Cornell’s PhD program. [Admission Insight] This is one of the most selective programs in the world, admitting only a handful of students each year. Exceptional research potential and a perfect or near-perfect GPA are usually necessary."
