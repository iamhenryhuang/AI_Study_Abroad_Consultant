        "content": "A common question that keeps showing up is should you send GRE scores if the university says they are optional.\n\nI have 2 screenshots here - UT Austin says they are \"Optional\" but read the entire statement - clearly they value it. Stanford says they simply do not consider GRE scores.\n\nConclusion: If you're applying to Stanford even with a 340 GRE it wont make a difference. But it will matter for UT Austin even though its \"optional\".\n\nWe also had another student share an email, in this sub, from Wisconsin-Madison that also has an Optional GRE Policy. The email from the admissions office clearly stated they recommend sending in GRE.\n\nMy personal opinion:\n\n\\- Always send in the GRE official scores and its gotta be strong. The Georgia Tech MSCS is a good baseline to shoot for (155Q / 153V / 3.0 AWA) which is actually quite doable based on what i've been seeing in this sub\n\n\\- A strong GRE is a sign you have met requirements set by a well known standardized system.\n\n\\- Taking the GRE signals readiness for graduate school and that you are serious about it.\n\n\\- Sending official scores signals you really want to go to that university.\n\nA common complain is its too expensive . To this I'll add that your living, boarding and tuition fee is significantly larger. If you have budgeted this expense already (you should have) then skimping on a very very small fraction to signal that you want an admit is actually a bad decision. Because you are spending time, a lot of time, with these apps, you must do everything it takes to actually get a good admit.\n\nWhy do Universities Care ?\n\nStudents care about Admit rates - the number of students who get an admit out of total applications\n\nUniversities care about another metric that few students know about - Yield Rate. The Yield rate is the rate of students who enroll after been given an admit. Universities run as well oiled businesses - they care about efficiency and operational excellence too. If they track that the number of students getting admits are not actually enrolling its a failure in their operational backend. Therefore they will give admits to those students who both meet their high standards AND are likely to take an admit if given one. \n\nIf on paper you are an excellent candidate but you fail to signal that you will take the admit - you actually wont get it. Failures to signal range from not applying earnestly (using AI to write your SOP basically shows you wont even put in the work to write an essay) to things you might consider silly like attending their webinars or engaging with their marketing. Lookup the concept of \"demonstrated interest\" in undergraduate admissions. It is also common for many American parents to spend a whole year planning travel to various universities in USA for campus tours because it signals interest. Sending strong official GRE scores is a loud and clear message that you are a serious contender.\n\nAnother related concern: Multiple GRE scores and how are these handled?\n\nAdmission officers already trust that the GRE standardized test is standardized so all questions that show up are valid for measurement. So in the best case they will accept the high score in each category across the multiple tests. In the worst case they will average the scores for each category. But you can be sure they wont take the lowest score as the actual score because it translates to saying their trust in the GRE is also low.\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1pg9wcl/whats_the_average_gpa_for_stanford_mscs_admits/",
        "content": "\nHi all, I’m a current junior at a T10 in the US majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, sitting at around a 3.8 GPA right now. I have been offered a full tuition scholarship for graduate school in the US, so I’m planning to apply to Stanford’s MSCS program and wanted to get a realistic sense of how competitive my GPA is.\n\nDoes anyone know the typical GPA range for admitted MSCS students at Stanford? I’ve seen mixed things online — some say 3.7+ is fine, others say you practically need a 3.9+. If you’ve been admitted, know people who have, or have insight from faculty/advisors, I’d really appreciate hearing what GPA ranges are common.\n\n I’ve checked the official website, but they don’t publish stats for admitted cohorts.\n\nDoes anyone (current students or alumni) know of any general GPA ranges, department presentations, or admissions info sessions where the MSCS program shared cohort data.",
