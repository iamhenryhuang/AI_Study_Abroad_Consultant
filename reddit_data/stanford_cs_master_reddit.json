        "content": "# Non-traditional applicant seeking advice: CS → Computational Biology PhD prospects?\n\n  \n**Background:**\n\n* BS Computer Science, 2.8 GPA (worked 2 jobs throughout college to maintain scholarship, came from low-income background)\n* 2 years at FAANG company\n* Co-founded AI startup focused on generative AI/diffusion models (currently doing well enough), been running for almost 4 years. I am the founding engineer albeit my work has been mostly getting the backend and infra to work, not necessarily the ai side\n* Self-studied biology, molecular biology, and basic organic chemistry over the past year\n* Currently starting research project in synthetic biology for protein design with a colleague\n\n**Target:** Computational Biology PhD programs, specifically labs working on protein design/synthetic biology\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. What are realistic target schools given my profile? I know the GPA is a major red flag, but hoping my industry experience and current research direction might help offset it.\n2. Should I be looking at CS programs with computational biology focuses, or dedicated computational bio programs? What's the typical difference in admission requirements?\n3. How important will it be to have publications from my current research project before applying? We're just getting started, I don't think there will be anything substantial before application deadlines.\n4. Any advice on how to frame the career transition narrative? I'm genuinely passionate about this field but worried it might look like I'm just following trends.\n5. Should I consider doing a master's first to strengthen my bio background and GPA, or go straight for PhD applications? I'm also considering joining a AI biotech startup or a lab as an RT/RA if I don't get into grad school.\n\nI've identified labs at the following institutions doing relevant work: MIT, Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCSF, Northwestern, UT Austin, UW, Rice, Johns Hopkins, Columbia, UNC Chapel Hill, U of Oregon, UIC, Vanderbilt, Scripps, plus several international options (Oxford, EPFL, Groningen, Barcelona, IST Austria, Leipzig, Graz, Weizmann).\n\nI'm willing to cast a wide net geographically and am particularly interested in programs that value interdisciplinary backgrounds. Any insights from current students, recent admits, or faculty would be hugely appreciated!\n\n**Stats summary for quick reference:**\n\n* GPA: 2.8 (CS)\n* GRE: Not taken yet\n* Research: Starting project in protein design\n* Industry: 2 years FAANG + startup co-founder\n* Publications: None yet (research just starting)\n* My boss, the colleague and a prof from undergrad I did my senior research project with have all agreed to write me recs.\n\n(i used claude to organize my word vomit to write this btw, but i am a real person)"

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an international student at a top CS school in the US, currently in my senior year. This cycle, I was admitted to my own school's master's program but rejected by Stanford MSCS. After some reflection, I realized I really want to study at Stanford - enough that I'm seriously considering reapplying, even if it means giving up the more straightforward path: graduating this year, completing my master's here, and starting working full-time.\n\nI’d really appreciate any thoughts on:\n\n1. Whether reapplying is worth it.\n2. How I should approach planning the timeline for a re-application.\n\nPersonally, I'm drawn to Stanford because I really want to experience what makes it one of the best universities in the world. I also believe going to a different school, rather than staying where I am, would give me a fresh perspective and benefits both my career and personal growth. \n\nAs for the timeline, I see two potential options:\n\n* Option 1: Complete the master's at my current school within a year, then spend another year and a half pursuing a second master's at Stanford if I’m fortunate enough to be admitted.\n* Option 2: Decline my current admission, take a gap year to reapply, and potentially work in internships or research roles during that time.\n\nEach option has its pros and cons. The obvious drawbacks include the diminishing returns of earning two master's degrees and the career opportunity cost of a gap year. I'd love to hear if anyone sees a third option I haven’t considered, or if you have general advice on navigating this decision.\n\nThanks so much for your insights!"
