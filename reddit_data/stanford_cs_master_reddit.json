I am the founding engineer albeit my work has been mostly getting the backend and infra to work, not necessarily the ai side\n* Self-studied biology, molecular biology, and basic organic chemistry over the past year\n* Currently starting research project in synthetic biology for protein design with a colleague\n\n**Target:** Computational Biology PhD programs, specifically labs working on protein design/synthetic biology\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. What are realistic target schools given my profile? I know the GPA is a major red flag, but hoping my industry experience and current research direction might help offset it.\n2. Should I be looking at CS programs with computational biology focuses, or dedicated computational bio programs? What's the typical difference in admission requirements?\n3. How important will it be to have publications from my current research project before applying? We're just getting started, I don't think there will be anything substantial before application deadlines.\n4. Any advice on how to frame the career transition narrative? I'm genuinely passionate about this field but worried it might look like I'm just following trends.\n5. Should I consider doing a master's first to strengthen my bio background and GPA, or go straight for PhD applications? I'm also considering joining a AI biotech startup or a lab as an RT/RA if I don't get into grad school.\n\nI've identified labs at the following institutions doing relevant work: MIT, Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCSF, Northwestern, UT Austin, UW, Rice, Johns Hopkins, Columbia, UNC Chapel Hill, U of Oregon, UIC, Vanderbilt, Scripps, plus several international options (Oxford, EPFL, Groningen, Barcelona, IST Austria, Leipzig, Graz, Weizmann).\n\nI'm willing to cast a wide net geographically and am particularly interested in programs that value interdisciplinary backgrounds. Any insights from current students, recent admits, or faculty would be hugely appreciated!\n\n**Stats summary for quick reference:**\n\n* GPA: 2.8 (CS)\n* GRE: Not taken yet\n* Research: Starting project in protein design\n* Industry: 2 years FAANG + startup co-founder\n* Publications: None yet (research just starting)\n* My boss, the colleague and a prof from undergrad I did my senior research project with have all agreed to write me recs.\n\n(i used claude to organize my word vomit to write this btw, but i am a real person)"

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an international student at a top CS school in the US, currently in my senior year. This cycle, I was admitted to my own school's master's program but rejected by Stanford MSCS. After some reflection, I realized I really want to study at Stanford - enough that I'm seriously considering reapplying, even if it means giving up the more straightforward path: graduating this year, completing my master's here, and starting working full-time.\n\nI’d really appreciate any thoughts on:\n\n1. Whether reapplying is worth it.\n2. How I should approach planning the timeline for a re-application.\n\nPersonally, I'm drawn to Stanford because I really want to experience what makes it one of the best universities in the world. I also believe going to a different school, rather than staying where I am, would give me a fresh perspective and benefits both my career and personal growth. \n\nAs for the timeline, I see two potential options:\n\n* Option 1: Complete the master's at my current school within a year, then spend another year and a half pursuing a second master's at Stanford if I’m fortunate enough to be admitted.\n* Option 2: Decline my current admission, take a gap year to reapply, and potentially work in internships or research roles during that time.\n\nEach option has its pros and cons. The obvious drawbacks include the diminishing returns of earning two master's degrees and the career opportunity cost of a gap year. I'd love to hear if anyone sees a third option I haven’t considered, or if you have general advice on navigating this decision.\n\nThanks so much for your insights!"

Should I aim to get published, or is gaining solid research experience enough?\n\t•\tLetters of recommendation: What can I do now to secure strong recommendations from professors or supervisors?\n\t•\tGRE or other tests: If you’ve applied as an international student, how significant are standardized tests, and how can I prepare effectively?\n\t•\tGeneral tips: Anything that helped you (or someone you know) succeed in gaining admission to top grad schools.\n\nI’d also love to hear personal stories from people who’ve made a similar transition—especially those who studied in the UK and went on to Ivy League schools or equivalent programs.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this, and I’d be incredibly grateful for any insights, resources, or tips!\n"

        "content": "Hey everyone, hope this finds you well. I'm currently a student doing my bachelor's in CS at Georgia Tech. Recently I've come to realize that I really enjoy the idea of potentially being an educator in a higher learning environment, and have started to more seriously think about pursuing education after my Bachelor's. I do have some questions for if this is a fool's errand, though.\n\nMy undergraduate career has been a little rocky; I originally came to Georgia Tech after graduating high school in 2018. I did poorly my first year majoring in CS and dropped out of Tech with a 2.21 GPA. I then took a semester off, took some classes at a local community college, and then COVID happened. At the time, I had really wanted to be in the games industry, so I transferred from GT to RIT and majored in game design for 3 semesters. With COVID, I was home from Fall 2019 to Spring 2022, and took classes remotely at RIT my first two semesters, while working at GameStop to help my parents. I then spent another year at RIT in-person, where I changed my major from game design to software engineering. I also was a teaching assistant for a class in the Fall 2021 semester while at RIT, and my final GPA at RIT was a 3.88. After switching to software engineering, however, I had realized that I could be doing something very similar at Georgia Tech, in a program I had worked extremely hard to get into in my high school days. So I readmitted myself at GT, and have been here since the Fall 2022 semester.\n\nSince returning, I have fared much better at Tech. My major GPA is a 3.6 and my overall GPA of the classes I have taken since returning is a 3.5, and both of those numbers will only rise as I finish up my degree here. I have been a teaching assistant for our data structures and algorithms class for a year now, taken on 2 (soon to be 3) professional internships, have multiple leadership positions on campus, and have strong relationships with several professors in the computer science department. I am also planning on taking on a year-long research-based junior design option beginning in the autumn.\n\nMy GPA, however, tends to haunt me here. My overall GPA is a 2.91, and while that will creep over to a 3.0 by the end of this semester, it's still obviously low. My GPA(s) have generally been much better since my first year of undergrad, but I know that, to an admissions committee, this may not mean anything. \n\nMy question is if it's worth even applying to T50 CS master's programs after I graduate, if at all. I believe that I have made great strides in my undergraduate career, with tangible accomplishments to show that. I don't expect to go to Stanford or Berkeley, but if there's a way I could turn what I have into a master's here at GT or a different school, I would be open to the possibility. I do intend to take the GRE and ultimately believe I can get my GPA to or above a 3.5 if I continue at the pace I have been so far. Would it be more valuable to spend a few years in the real world then consider applying? Will any amount of experience be enough to help me overcome this burden?\n\nAny advice or opinions are appreciated. I'd rather honestly hear if it's worth pursuing this before I get my hopes up or spend a great deal of money only to face failure. "
