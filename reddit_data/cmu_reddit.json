        "title": "[Admissions Advice] Stanford MSCS @250k vs CMU MSR/MSCV/MSML @150k",
        "content": "Hi, this is all just wishful overthinking. But hypothetically if someone gets into both Stanford MSCS which costs around 250k (bay area living costs) and CMU which costs 150k (MSR/MSCV/MSML), which one would you prefer and why?\n\nAssume I can self-fund around 100k with support from my family and my savings. So another way of asking this is 100k extra debt, worth a Stanford degree over CMU?\n\nI am mostly interested in Stanford because of the crazy professors and the research which goes on there, and the obvious proximity to SV. CMU is also great in these regards, but I just seem to have a bias towards stanford because of having practically taught myself AI from their courses and also interacting with a few stanford people in my previous company, who seemed on a totally different level compared to a lot of my friends who are in/are alums of CMU. But this might be biased because they were type A founder types and might suffer from selection bias, whereas my friends at CMU were well, my friends and at a similar level as me\n\nMy motivation for masters is to do top tier AI research (RL/diffusion/world models/robotics and the likes) and do some hard courses along with smart peers. (Stefano's CS 236, and Chelsea Finn's meta learning course and the recent LLMs from Scratch are amongst my all time favorites. Although CMU's NLP course by Graham Neubig was also crazy good and on par with CS224n). As for a job, I am fairly ok with any job that is tackling some hard problems, and also lets me clear my loans in approx 2 years.\n\nEdit - The post is just a thought experiment about potential tradeoffs from a guy who has a lot of free time due to being currently jobless (in between jobs) and lowkey ragebait, so you can troll me all you want lmao, in it for the fun :P \n\nmy\\_qualifications:\n\n* BTech CS from an IIT (top 7), 9.5 GPA\n* Multiple research internships in college at academic colleges both in India (IISc, IIITD) and abroad (CMU, UofT)\n* 3.5 YoE, 1.5 years at MSFT as a Data Scientist, currently 2 years at a Sequoia backed AI startup in India (one of the india AI ones, top 3-4 in India imo), working on foundational speech and vision models\n* 4 A\\* conf papers including CVPR and NeurIPS (not first author though in any), also a nice speech scaling laws paper with Chris Manning as an author at got rejected at ICML recently, and a few other rejected preprints\n* Strong open-source experience as well (multiple core pipeline PRs into HF Diffusers)\n* My LoRs - 1 from CEO of current startup (GaTech + Stanford alum/FAIR RE), 1 from UofT CS prof, 1 from MSFT manager, 1 from IIITD prof with whom I have 2 A\\* papers, 1 from IIT prof\n* GRE - 340/340, TOEFL - 113/120\n* Teaching experience - Not really, but run my own yt channel explaining papers, and was head of 3 socities in campus including the AI and CS one, so used to take a lot of lectures/workshops there"

        "content": "After 2 months of radio silence I finally got my first admission! However, I saw that we have to pay a $4000 non-refundable tuition deposit to secure my spot in the next 2 weeks. I am not so sure about this since this is my first admit and I am still waiting for other schools to make their decisions. Is it worth it?\n\nOther programs that I've applied to:\n\nStanford-MSCS, CMU-MIIS, CMU-LTI MLT, UCBerkeley-MSCS, UIUC-MSCS, UCLA-MSCS\n\nMy profile:\n\nTier 1 university in Taiwan (National Taiwan University QS63), CS major, GPA 4.13/4.3, TOEFL 114, 1 research paper accepted/presented in IEEE ASRU, 3-month SWE internship at Google Taiwan, Club president of iOS Club at my uni (not sure if this helps in any way), LoRs: 2 from my research advisors and one from my manager at Google\n\nDo i have a chance in any other of these? Or is Columbia my best bet\n\nAlso, does anyone know when the decisions of the programs that i've applied to usually come out?\n\nedit: I forgot to mention one program that I've also applied to: Yale-MSCS"

        "title": "[Exams and Scores] GRE Requirement at Carnegie Mellon University",
        "content": "I wasn't sure if I should submit official GRE scores to CMU for my MSCS application or if unofficial scores suffice, so I decided to email the admissions office, and here's the reply I received:\n\n    Hello ***,\n    My name is Angy and I am the program manager for the MSCS program here at CMU. We appreciate your interest in studying computer science at CMU (CS at CMU is a topic we are personally very excited about too). \n    To answer your question, our policy for GRE states \"the GRE is strongly recommended in order to apply to the MSCS program, especially for students who do not have clear documentation of strong mathematical proficiency. If you cannot provide GRE scores, please briefly explain in your statement of purpose.\" Given that the GRE is not required, you may submit self-reported/unofficial scores.\n    Our application process is a very in-depth and holistic process in which our admissions committee evaluates the variety of information in a prospective student’s application. Our approach to admissions is more than just classes, test scores and background statistics.\n    I hope this information is helpful.\n\nSo I wanted to share this update with the community.\n\nThis also provides an idea of what even GRE optional universities really think of the GRE."

        "content": "Found these admission stats very interesting.\n\n* MSCS  - 5% (very competitive as expected)\n* MLT Language technologies - 1% (insane)\n* MS ML/CV - 15\\~25% (seems higher than expected)\n* MSE (Software Eng) - 59% (surprised to see such an extremely low bar for admission, probably easier than most MSCS programs in the USA for admission. Seems very cash-cow like columbia, but it does seem to have good outcomes as employers probably only look at the CMU tag.)"

I was going to apply to it as well but for some reason, chose not to.\n\nHere my profile details:\nSpecialisation: (Distributed) Systems\n\nTop 5 IIT, EE major with CS minor, gpa: ~8.8/10, I think this converts to about ~3.7/4, better grades in CS courses than others\n\nPresented a paper at ACM conference, won the best paper | \nAn accepted journal article | \nFirst-authored both and both were in colab with my clg and a CMU's lab | \nReviewer at a conference | \n1 yr research in EE (probably doesn't matter as much?) \n\n2 yrs Big tech exp | \nTechnical cofounder for a startup, related to specialisation\n\nGRE: 328 (170Q, 158V)\n\nWhat's making me anxious is the short list of colleges I applied to, all MSCS:\nStanford, CMU, Cornell, UIUC, UT Austin \n\nStanford mostly admits students with almost perfect gpas and Cornell prefers students with teaching experience. What do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: Applied* for fall 2025"
