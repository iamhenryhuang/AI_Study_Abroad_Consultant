        "content": "Hello, been getting many DMs about joining Manipal (main campus), so I figured I’d write this out in one place. I was in this position a few years ago, so this might help some of you.\n\nSpeaking only from the perspective of MIT CSE.\n\n(Please don’t ask me about board marks or MET rank — I have no clue.)\n\nOne request: try to read this with a bit of perspective. Revisiting this sub reminded me how skewed our understanding of college was during JEE prep. You can’t boil everything down to numbers or rankings and expect a clean “X &gt; Y” answer. There are too many variables, and college choices are personal.\n\n## 1. When/Why Manipal\n\nJoin Manipal **only if** you don’t have a better Tier 1 option. Let’s not complicate this: BITS, IITs, and the top 3–4 NITs are objectively better. Choose them if you can. \n\nIf you’re deciding between core branches at Tier 1 vs. CSE at Manipal, it’s a judgement call. Personally, I left a mid-tier NIT and BITS Hyderabad Mech/ENI for MIT CSE, and I’m okay with that choice — but I knew I didn’t want to do core engineering at all.\n\n(That said, if you leave IIT core for this, I will judge you a little.)\n\nBranch does matter — especially now. A CS background filters you into a lot more hiring pools. Many companies just don’t consider core branches anymore unless it’s a specialized role.\n\nMIT CSE is ahead of SRM, MUJ, NM, etc., and about comparable to VIT Vellore or TIET. If you’re from North India, TIET’s a solid option. That said, Manipal has stronger international brand recall, thanks to its alumni network, so it has an edge for master’s abroad.\n\nAs for VIT: more academic flexibility and better course structure, yes — but the campus culture, scale, and crowding are real issues. Unless cost is a factor, I’d lean toward Manipal.\n\n## 2. Fees\n\nMIT is expensive. Everything I say here only applies **if** you can afford it without major financial strain. \n\nIf your next-best options are Tier 3, then a loan might be justifiable. But keep in mind — this only works if **you** hold up your end. That means a strong CGPA (8.5+), a decent resume, and active involvement. The jump from Tier 3 to Tier 2 is bigger than from Tier 2 to Tier 1, so it can be worth it. But again, weigh that against debt.\n\n## 3. \"Manipal is full of drugs\"\n\nThis was a popular belief years ago, but not anymore. Post-COVID, the crackdown was intense. Getting anything now is more difficult and expensive here than it is anywhere else. Admin has been hypersensitive about the rep, so it’s mostly a non-issue now.\n\n## 4. Academics\n\nCore CS subjects are handled reasonably well. Newer topics (like AI/ML, blockchain, etc.) are still hit-or-miss.\n\nFaculty quality varies — some are decent, others are avoidable. It’s not hard to score, but don’t get complacent.\n\n**Maintain a CGPA above 8.5.** That opens most doors — placements, projects, exchanges, everything. The first 3 semesters are crucial. Slacking early will cost you.\n\n## 5. Extracurriculars\n\nThis is where Manipal shines the most. It offers things called **student projects** , these are essentially communities where:\n\n- First year is a taskphase - seniors mentor you and give you resources to build your basics and get good at whatever you signed up for.\n\n- In the second and third year, you work with the rest of the team on projects such as Formula Racing, Drones, Robotics, Rovers, or even Cryptography and Hackathons.\n\nA lot of projects even offer research divisions, where people publish in journals and attend conferences abroad. Most good projects also go to the US and Europe annually to participate in big competitions, and Manipal does quite well in them.\n\nThis is where most of the actual learning happens. You’ll pick up many skills based on whatever project you've opted for. Extremely good for exposure, connections, industry-style experience, and having a strong network of hardworking individuals.\n\nThese projects have extremely strict taskphases - out of a pool of 150+ students, generally only 10–12 make it to the team. This rigor is what makes them this good.\n\nMore info here:\n\n(https://www.manipal.edu/mit/mit-experience/mit-videos/major-student-projects.html)\n\nThese also help you build very strong resumes for applying to master's programs abroad. I’ve seen notable alumni from each of these projects go to places like Stanford, Oxford, CMU, Harvard, and so on.\n\n## 6. Placements\n\nFor the last year or two, there has been a recession going on, so of course MIT has felt the effects as well. In my first year, CSE placement had a median of ₹13 LPA and an average close to ₹16 LPA, but that was during the bubble.\n\nRight now, those numbers are likely down by ₹3–3.5 LPA. Still, from personal experience, most seniors get very decent jobs if you:\n\n- Practice enough DSA\n\n- Maintain a 7.5+ GPA\n\n- Have some degree of extracurricular involvement\n\nOpportunities are present, companies like Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon, and Goldman come every year but you **do need to stand out**.\n\nThis is where the Tier 1 adva",
