        "title": "IS + DS - The Masters At Landing Top Internships",
        "content": "I see a lot of hate for the program which I simply do not see. I have now been in the program for almost 2 years and have landed multiple internships at top companies. Honestly, from everyone in my year in this program, it's insane how many people are landing top offers (check for yourself on LinkedIn). Im not sure if this specific class is just cracked but IS + DS majors have fully mastered recruiting and everyone has a top offer whether in big tech, consulting, banks, and I have even seen people getting into quant. Not to throw shade or anything to the cs department, but it seems as if cs students are struggling looking for jobs while IS + DS students have the market down.\n\nYou may now ask why or how this has happened? Im here to answer that for you.\n\n1. The coursework reached you EVERYTHING you need to ace technical interviews and the program allows for students to spend lots of time in recruiting. Classes such as stat 207, Is 327, IS 206, stat 107, MATH 227, CS 307, IS 445 and more have been so helpful. These courses teach you the skills to master interviews at a deep technical level. Not only do you learn how to code everything, but they teach you decision making. You know what decisions to make when and in different situations, consequences and positives of each decision, and why some decisions are better than others. You are taught everything in a technical and conceptual level which is exactly what you need for interviews.\n\nThe coursework is without a doubt easier than the CS program which also allows these guys to have so much time to focus on recruiting. That's why everyone has top offers.\n\n2. Plenty of research opportunities. It is a graduation requirement to be involved with research for 2 semesters. Not only do you gain valuable experience, you get resume material for that for something that is a graduation requirement in the course. My research opportunities helped me land my first internship which ultimately later on helped me land a bigger internship for this summer.\n\n3. Data Science Club (IDSC): If you are not familiar, this club is one of the best RSOs that UIUC has to offer in any major. They teach you data science concepts, teach you the full pipeline, allow you to work on a semester long advanced project, and learn to present to stakeholders. Every semester, they host a competition called the data dive which is catered for data science projects. Through this club, I have learned so much about advanced topics such as deep learning. I have also learned how to put together a professional presentation and present my project in the most effective way to technical and non technical audiences. The skills you develop from this club cannot be stressed enough. I have 3 projects on this resume strictly from this club and it has been s vital in my recruitment journey.\n\nI have seen so much hate on reddit on this program and that is due to people not taking advantage of resources or putting in what you need to for each class. This program is more than enough to land you a top job in big tech, consulting, banks, and can land you roles in Data Science, Quant, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, and many more. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out. Just wanted to give you my perspective and my experience on how I and many others have become successful in this program."

        "content": "Hey everyone! I’m an out-of-state CS admit deciding between UIUC and UCLA. I just went on a 2-day UIUC tour and the campus is great, however I can't visit UCLA, so I want to hear both sides.\n\nI’m looking for FAANG opportunities, start-up experience, and strong research involvement (prefer aerospace + CS research), so my biggest priorities are internships, networking, and long-term career growth. I know UIUC is ranked #5 for CS with strong midwest industry ties, while UCLA has a smaller CS class size and great FAANG/start-up placement, especially with its alumni presence and reputation internationally.\n\nI  mind the location a little bit, and cost isn’t a factor, I just want to make the best choice for my future. If you’re a current student at either schools and have any insight, I’d love to hear about:\n\n* CS curriculum &amp; class sizes\n* Internships &amp; FAANG placement\n* Alumni Network\n* AI/ML &amp; research opportunities\n* 4+1 / MS pathways\n* Dorms, housing, &amp; cost of living\n* Campus life, clubs, and CS extracurriculars\n* Quarter vs. semester system &amp; workload\n* Big city (LA) vs. college town (UIUC) experience (professionally and socially)\n\nThe biggest deciding factor for me is how many classes I can skip. I have a lot of AP and dual enrollment credit, and I know both college can let me do courses in 3 years ish, unless UIUC is more flexible with credits. Thank you!"

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n  \nI’ve been fortunate to be admitted to both the UChicago MPCS (9-Course) and UIUC MCS (On-campus Urbana) master's programs. \n\nAs an international student on a full scholarship that covers tuition, living expenses, and accommodations, cost of living isn't a big concern for me. My main deciding factor is which program would be better in terms of learning, portfolio development, and overall usefulness in the tech field, as I need to complete my degree in one year.\n\nI’d love to hear from alumni or anyone who’s been in a similar position. What are the pros and cons of each program? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance!"

        "title": "My OMSCS Exit Post! From middle school science teacher -&gt; AI Engineer in 2 years.",
        "content": "**Just finished Georgia Tech OMSCS in 2 years – Full Exit Review**\n\nI started coding at age 37 with basic Arduino, switched careers from teaching science/STEAM in California, and moved to rural Japan to study full-time. Two years later, I’ve finished OMSCS with the Machine Learning specialization, landed an internship in Tokyo, and am now a full-time AI engineer for braking systems in Japan.\n\nBelow is my full program review – including my background, application experience, networking story, and detailed reviews of every class I took (with hours/week, grades, and tips). Hopefully this helps anyone considering OMSCS or planning their course path.\n\n**My Story**\n\nI graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from a well-known American university that’s not Ivy League in 2003. After graduating, I worked for a few years as a plumbing engineer, which I found boring. I then spent some time exploring other life directions before eventually moving into teaching.\n\nFor 13 years, I worked as a science, math, and technology teacher at private schools in California. About halfway through that period, I taught myself Arduino, which led to some small electronics contract work for artists. It wasn’t a huge part of my career, but it was my first real introduction to coding—at around age 37—and even then it was just basic Arduino programming.\n\nOver my last three years of teaching, I transitioned into a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) role for middle school science. I tried to incorporate as much Python teaching as I could, but the challenges and limitations of teaching made me realize it wasn’t sustainable as a long-term career. I began planning my exit strategy—taking on as much Python tutoring as I could to build skills and income for a transition.\n\nBy October 2022, I committed fully to switching into the tech field. At that time, I planned to self-study or possibly take individual courses. My wife’s family owned an unused countryside home near where they lived, so we sold both our cars, got rid of most of our belongings, and moved there. Since we were renting, didn’t own a house, and didn’t have kids, we decided to take advantage of the freedom to make such a big change. I arranged remote Python tutoring for about seven hours a week so I could focus on learning full-time.\n\nI only learned about Georgia Tech’s OMSCS program after we had already decided to move. Once I found out about it, I applied and decided to make it my full-time focus.\n\n**Applying**\n\nI applied to three online master’s programs:\n\n* The new Machine Learning/AI program at UT Austin\n* The MCS program at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC)\n* Georgia Tech’s OMSCS\n\nAt the time, my Python skills were intermediate from self-study, including some of a popular Udemy course. I didn’t know algorithms and considered myself between beginner and intermediate in programming. For the UIUC application, I took a short online algorithms course but failed it; I still applied using that experience.\n\nFor Georgia Tech, I reached out to my undergraduate advisor from 20 years earlier. We had stayed loosely in touch, and he remembered me well enough to write a glowing recommendation letter, which I believe made a big difference. In my application, I emphasized my project experience.\n\nResults: Admitted to Georgia Tech, rejected by both UT Austin and UIUC.\n\n**Preparing**\n\nAfter being accepted, I bought a new MacBook M2, which worked flawlessly throughout OMSCS. There were just a few cases in DL where I needed to use Google Colab instead of my mac, but it wasn't a problem.\n\nBefore moving to Japan, I joined the OMSCS community on Reddit and posted about my upcoming move. A student living Tokyo (shout out to Christian) in connected me to a Line chat group (Japan’s popular communication tool) with a dozen or so active OMSCS students in the Tokyo area who meet up a couple times a year. I had a video chat with that same student who was close to finishing, which was helpful. Even though I lived far from Tokyo, I stayed connected by occasionally posting in the group and hoped to meet them in person.\n\nI chose the Machine Learning specialization and made sure to join the (gaming-based chat website) server for each course. Connecting with active (gaming-based chat website) communities and engaging with classmates was one of the best things I did.\n\n**Tokyo OMSCS Meetup and Internship**\n\nIn August 2024, before the Fall semester began, I visited Tokyo for the first time since moving to Japan and attended an in-person Georgia Tech Tokyo OMSCS Meetup from that same Line group. Meeting classmates face-to-face strengthened those connections.\n\nAround this time, I began applying to internships in Tokyo and was pleasantly surprised by the positive response. The U.S. job market was tough, but Tokyo’s was much more reasonable. Employers recognized Georgia Tech, and my résumé stood out—especially my Kalman Catcher project from CS 7638 and my research work f"
